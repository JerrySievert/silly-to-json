Don't talk to strangers,
Because they're only there to do you harm.
Don't write in starlight,
Because the words may come out real.
Don't hide in doorways,
You may find the key that opens up your soul.
Don't go to heaven,
Because it's really only hell.
Don't smell the flowers,
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind.
Don't dream of women,
Because they'll only bring you down.

The Hall of Rules~

	Welcome to the hall of rules.  "Rules" start at 667, and go through
670.   Note:  At the current time, these are a copy of the rules on Temple.
However, they will be rewritten.

671-675 is a list of godly duties.  If you want to move up in levels, I
recommend that you read it.  

More will be added as thought of.

Temple rules on being immortal (supplied by conner)~
The mostly dont's of being immortal:

(1) On playing a mortal character:
    - ABSOLUTELY NO HELP WHAT-SO-EVER FOR ONE OF YOUR OWN MORTALS!
      The point being you have already achieved the goal of the game.
      By helping yourself in this way, you detract from others chances.
    - Don't pass on equipment, especially not to one of your own.
    - Don't give your 'old' characters to other people or I will treat
      them as if it is you. And DON'T let them play your immortal!
    - No playing both immortal/mortal types at the same time, there should
      be no legitimate need for this.
    - Similarly switching back and forth between mortal/immortal looks
      as though you are obtaining information to help you and you probably
      are, so don't.

(2) Assisting other players:
    - Advising a new player how to start is expected behavior, but
      advising him/her what his stats are or stats on an item is not.
      DO NOT inform people of object/monster stats!
    - DO NOT cast spells for mortals, and don't use spells against them
      ie casting Sanctuary on mobs.
    - Don't trans them around to avoid encounters or to put them in harms way.

Temple rules on being immortal (supplied by conner)~
(3) On Dealing with problem players:
    Don't just up and kill them. Don't use info you receive as immortal
    to come on and hunt-down/summon players for the purpose of killing.
    (This is not to say you couldn't advise someone who they were killed
     by. Just make sure it stays their affair and not yours.)
    Do try to talk to them and inform them where they are going wrong.
    Be polite, but if they are not polite in return there is no reason to
    listen to them. If they refuse to listen, either inform a higher level
    or get a couple other immortal witnesses. Then move them out of harms
    way and if need be strip them of equipment.

You invested time and effort in making immortal, but it is a privilage and
comes with a responsibility to act responsibly. Violators will be delt with.
I not exclude the possibility of deletion, demotion or banning immortals.
You should read the wizard board each visit to stay informed of any changes
to policy.

Temple rules on being immortal (supplied by conner)~
 If you wish to continue to play as a mortal there a few things I
would like you to keep in mind:

1) Don't be an item hog. You should not be keeping equipment for
   more than ONE player. If you play more than one character that
   is fine, but I would hope you wouldn't play more than one at
   a time.

2) The items you keep should be minimal. No reason why you should
   have 2 energy bows, a katana and a claw. You can't use them all
   at once so why have them. Same for armour and other items. If
   you can't use them at the same time you probably have too much.
   Items you get rid of should NOT be sold but put on the dump so
   they circulate back to the game and other people have the chance
   to experience getting them.

3) Avoid the urge to curry favor amoung people by 'starting' out
   newbies with a generous helping of experience points and or
   items. Give a modest amount of gold if you like or take them
   on a mini-tour of areas they can handle. They will have more
   fun if they can experience things for themselves. Anyone you
   group with should be of approximately the same level.

Temple rules on being immortal (supplied by conner)~
If you are noted violating these conditions your items may be removed
or if a repeat offender demotion or erasure or mortals may be called for.
I don't wish to restrict your playing entirely - I'm glad you enjoy what
I have created enough to go back for more. But you must keep in mind that
there are other people playing and they deserve to have the same opportunities
and struggles you hopefully went through.
 If there is anyone that can't live up to these responsibilities, you should
consider finding another mud to pass your time on.

the reeds that marks your exit from the marsh!  The hut must have been
invisible when you entered, because it is partly set into the marsh and
would be out of view if you were facing in the opposite direction.

There are two copper braziers in which the incense is smouldering.  On the
ground, several white grubs wriggle and writhe.  All in all, this is a very

Exxon's Retreat~
     As you step through the mirror you feel a tingling sensation run
through your body.  Much to your surprise you are standing on dusty
clifftop overlooking a magnificient ocean.  The sun seems to be frozen
just over the horizon, turning the ocean into a swirling plain of gold
and black reflections.  A warm and gentle breeze brushes your face.
You hear the roar of the waves crashing rhythmically on the rocks below,
interspersed with cries of seagulls floating lazily overhead.
     To the north you can see a large city by the oceanside, far larger
than Midgaard, perhaps far larger than any city you've seen before.  It
seems to extend infinitely to the north.  From this distance the city
resembles a spectacular field of colorful lights, twinkling before you
in silent majesty.

fires crackle within and heavy blue smoke pours into a vent in the cieling.
A rune encrusted mithril anvil is in the center of the room, looking well
used and other tools of metalurgy hang on a rack which floats about three
meters in the air of its own force.

Between the shelves~
  You are in the great library of magic. The shelves seem uncomfortably 
close here, you can barely manuver between them. The musty smell is still
strong, and the elusive books still hover just out of reach.
  A faint flicker of light can barely be made out to the north.

The reading room~
  You are in a small room completely devoid of furnishings. The only thing
here is an enormous tome, lying face open on the floor. The great book looks
both heavy and ancient. Its jewel encrusted bindings are well worn as the
bark of a tree. Spidery writings seem to crawls across the pages, totally
uncomprehensible to your mortal eye. Something seems to be wedged between
the pages.

  A grey tiled hallway leads south, black tiled east, white tiled west, and
a multi-colored hallway swirling with patterns that remain just barely

North and South and the only exit is to the East. Several tables and chairs
are about this section and a desk in on the far wall.

Sanctum of the Monastary~
   The monks gather here to pray to the gods at various times of the day,
though at any given time there is almost gauranteed to be a few monks here
chanting, praying, or humming. The Monastary Entrance is to the North and to
the East seems to be the Dining Hall were the monks eat.

   At the time of this area's creation, monk skills had not yet been decided
or defined on effects. As soon as it is possible, this will be altered to
reflect the new information.

E
attacks~
The formula used for the number of attacks that an unarmed monk will get per
round will be: (level-1)/16 +1   --The fractional portion will provide the
probability of getting an extra attack each round. (ie. if you were VERY
lucky, a 2nd level monk could get 2 attacks every round, but probably won't)

[a few samples: Level--#Att]
 1--1.00    5--1.25    9--1.50   13--1.75   17--2.00   21--2.25   25--2.50

Dining Hall~
   A long Table fills the room and you get the impression that it probably could
seat the entire monastary at one time. Not that they would probably all eat
at the same time since someone always seems to be training or praying.

               BOLD ADVENTURERS!!

   Recently, it seems that some nasty little monsters made a hole in our wall
dowstairs in the Cellar. We soundly trashed them and none of them have enough
courage to enter the Cellar again, however, the Monastary would appreciate it
if you would help us keep their numbers down and fear in their hearts.
   Though the Monastary could easily purge the menace, we just don't feel like
taking the time away from our prayers and training to do this. Any assistance
you provide would be appreciated and you may keep anything you find down
there as a reward for your help.

Cellar Under the Monastary~

Cellar is lit up with some magical lights but the tunnel seems to be lit by

to the Kitchen.

completely stomped by the monks. The tunnel seems to be lit by some sort of

see some female dragons cooking vegetable they find in the mountains and serve
it to the other. You are shocked to see dragon eating vegetables. Ever since
you were little, you were taught dragons were evil and that they constantly
ate human flesh for dinner. Another thing you notice was that the female
dragons are actually using matches to light up the stove. You questions why
don't they just use their fire breath. You suddenly remember from ancient
sources that there are actually two types of dragons that exist in the world.
The first is wild and untamed. They are the ones that cause great damage with
their breath and their destruction. The second, however, is quite intelligent.
Ancient man didn't know the difference and they foolishly declared war on all
the dragons of the world. These must have been where they went to!

rest holding a scepter of inordinate beauty. Its scales is pure platinum. He
looks at you with a blank stare and smile at you. HE is blind, you realize.
You are startled when it begins to talk in perfect human language, "Hello my
friends, welcome to my humble abode." Recalling from the various history lesson
you had as a child, you realize you have found the most powerful of all the
dragons, Semmus, the one and only Platinum Dragon. His strength and valor is
unmatched by any other. He is THE Dragon of all dragons. Next to him, Tiamat
the three headed dragon is his bodyguard protecting his master at all will.
Back of Tiamat, there are five brilliant gold dragons stand by his side, still
and menacing, also protecting their master. They look straight, beyond your
puny presence.

In the Mist~
As you enter the mist, it becomes hard for you to see anything around you.
The noise that you thought you didn't here gets louder and louder as if
something was approaching. Suddenly, blinking glowing yellow eyes swarm around
you, but you cannot determine who they are. You wish you can figure who or
what they are. THEY ATTACK!

short balding man sits on a chair, bored to death of his immortal life. It has
been said in the legends that he received his immortality from the god when he
built a gigantic ark and filled it with two of each animal. He survived the
flood, and the gods pleased at his action, gave him immortality. What the
legend failed to mention was that after he became immortal, he became
increasingly dissatisfied at his monotonous life. And in anger and frustration,
he decided to change the world. He started causing havoc in the world around
him and cut Dilmun from the rest of the world. No man has came here to
face him in duel. Remember he is mostly immortal.

help." When you assure him that you are not here to take him away, he smiles.
His voice all of a sudden changes and states, "sorry stranger, I cannot help
you kill Gilgamesh." When you ask him what the hell is talking about, he
explains that many are out to kill Gilgamesh for his girth. The girth is said
to be a item like none other and it gives the wearer magnificent abilities.

the secrets to life itself.  You can see stairs leading both up and down

A stairway leading down to the Wine Cellar is to your east.

This is the stairway leading from the inner church to the Observation
Deck where you can view the great town. You can see a small window that
you might be able to see out over the square from.

As you gaze through the wind you can see the out-lines of the
town, you can see the post office to the west, a large park to
south, and the town shops around the square.  The sky is red with fire,
and in all directions you can see rifts on the horizon, for some
reason it looks like the world is fighting against a time vortex.

and computer tapes.  Agaist the far wall is an SGI 4D/320, and a Sparc
IPX with a CD-ROM player. (currently there are headphones in the jack)

Pull up a chair and feel at home, just don't crash one of the systems.

Temple of Draagdim~
   You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Draagdim
The temple has been constructed of roughly hewn granite blocks, shaky in
appearance, and most of the walls are covered by crude figures of Rats,
vanquished cats, and Queeklor, God of the Rats.
   Tiny steps lead south through the temple gate, descending the mound
upon which the temple is built and ends in the temple square below.  In
the center of the room lies the sacrificial pit.  Feel free to jump
and sacrifice yourself to Queeklor.

My god, that's a cat. Yech.  There is a rather large greasy cook tending to

a human shaped dummy.  The dummy is outfitted in clothes with many
pockets, and closer inspection reveals that there are many bells on the
dummy.  Off to one side there is a box discarded in the corner.

Palace Road~
   You stand on a road made of iron pyrite bricks. Hmm, iron pyrite...
Isn't that fool's gold?  In that case you are standing on Fool's road.
The road is in a general state of disrepair.  Weeds poke through the
crumbling bricks in numerous places, and in some places small shrubs
have grown.  Back to the west is the Main Pathway and the road
continues on towards the palace.  To the east there is a high wall,
too tall for you to see over.

   Through one of the cracks you spie a jungle teaming with life.  You hear
the squawks of exotic birds flying around the treetops, but the jungle
is too dense to see very far into.

Palace Road~
   This is the end of the road.  The pyrite bricks end here and to the north
is the Palace Courtyard.  Do you dare to step off of Fool's Road?  After all
you were bright enough to get on it.  You might want to look ahead and see
what fate awaits you.

Palace Courtyard~
   This is a large courtyard outside the remains of a castle.  As you prowl
around the courtyard you find several large blocks of stone, apparently 
fallen from the decaying walls.  A skeleton of some sort lies under one
of the blocks.  The castle is old and cracked and only one story of it
remains; the upper parts have crumbled.  There seem to be a few creatures 
hiding near the castle gates.

Entry Way~
   The large castle gates open inward to reveal the dark confines of the
entry way.  There are empty doorways leading north, west and east, into
darkness.  Bits of rubble and trash are strewn about the floors.  The
doorway to the east still has the remnants of what was once a door.  The
door is shattered and small bits of twisted metal are all that remain
of the hinges.

West Hall~
   You are standing in the West Hall.  There is a fireplace built into the
west wall, and the remains of two plush chairs and three small tables lie
strewn about the room.  There is another doorway to the north and one to
the east.  There is a thick layer of dust covering the room.  Several
sets of tracks have disturbed the dust, but some of them are yours.

table fills the center of the room.  It is surrounded by twelve wooden
chairs.  The two chairs on the end are occupied by skeletons.  They are
all dressed in rags, apparently the remains of fine dinner clothes.  They
are sitting up, but they do not move.  On the table in front of each
chair lies a golden dinner plate.

Bedroom~
   This room was once a fine bedroom, but it's once rich furnishings,
the canopy bed, plush chairs, hardwood tables, and finely woven rugs,
are not tattered, moldy and worthless.  All the furniture in this room,
and the walls, show evidence of claw marks.  A sigh that probably means
that the Royal Rat Family still uses this room.  Curiously there is a
man-sized mirror on the east wall that appears to be untouched.

Throne Room~
   The echos of your footsteps echo hollowly in this large
barren room.  Boxes, dragged in from the west, have been
stacked into a rough paradoy of a throne.  High atop the
throne a regal rat sits, tinfoil crown tilted haughtily
sideways.  This rat is probably full of hot air more than
anything else.  (Aren't all people in high positions?)

The Entrance to the Guild of Magicians~
  Standing in front of this somewhat shaky structure is one of the largest
green kobolds you have ever seen.  It must stand about eight feet tall and
it wields an equally large weapon.  It seems that the mages here realized that
they are not much good defending against intruders, so they
went out and got the toughest monster that would work for them.  All they
could find was a green kobold, so it would appear that they modified it a bit.

Shattered Reality~
   The floor beneath you seems to buckle and waver beneath your feet.  Parts
of the floor have dissolved, revealing nothingness beneath.  Other parts of
the floor buble and hiss angrily.  The walls are shattered, and in some
places it would appear that you could walk through them.  This room has been
abandoned because it is no longer completely attached to this reality.  In
the center of the room lies a stone of some sort, it appears to be holding
the room together.

   As you step through the wall you notice that the horizon is a lot closer
than it normally is and the clouds are a lot nearer to your head.  There
doesn't really appear to be much here, but wait!  What is that under your
foot?  It looks like you have stepped on someone's town square, market
square, common square and a lot of other places you can't seem to identify

   You stand in a very rocky area.  Large boulders lie strewn about in random
clumps.  Here and there large bunches of broad bladed plants loom in your way.
Far off in the south a large structure pokes it's roof far above everything
else.  Every once and a while you hear a loud buzzing overhead.  The buzzing
seems to come from enormous flies, the size of elephants.  I don't think
we're in Draagdim anymore.

Cleric's Inner Sanctum~
   This room is entirely black, except for little slpotches of
color that appear at random.  Closer inspection reveals that
they are in fact little flowers.  Daisies perhaps.  How could
they have gotten there?  Perhaps that little man in the robes
is responsible for it. Oh, there he goes again.  With a wicked
grin, he paints another daisy on the wall.  What an idiot.
Wait a minute, that is your guildmaster.

   As you walk towards the structure you notice that it doesn't seem to be
getting any closer.  It is either really far off and really large, or it
is running away from you.  From the likes of the bugs you've seen here
it is probably a gigantic structure and you might never reach it in this
lifetime.

    The air up here is suprisingly fresh, a nice change from the muggy
air below.  You are standing on a light criss-cross of branches and
vines which just barely support your weight.  Going much further in
any direction would probably lead you to your death.  Spindly creatures
swing from branch to branch screaming at you for your intrusion to their
domain.

and there seems to be a small stream running through the gully.  Ten feet
below the branch is a small path.  The only way down to the path is a

   You are standing in a narrow ravine.  A small trickle of slimy water
swirls around your ankles only to disappear further down the gulley.  The
steep ravine walls to either side of you are very steep and the bedrock
is worn smooth in many places.  It looks too steep to climb.  The branch

appear to be lounging around behind it.

Daimyo Fort~
   You have entered the Daimyo Fort.  To the west you see a rusted crank
that may have once been used to raise and lower the portcullis behind you.
From the looks of the crank you would guess that the portcullis has been
opened by hand for a very long time.  The rest of the fort open out before
you, but overall it doesn't appear to be very big.  The gulley appears
to have ended at the barricade, and now you are closed in by large timber
walls that seem to reach to the sky.  If you continue towards the east you
will be in the center of the fort.  If the portcullis is open you can go
west.

   Standing next to the inner gates sends chills up your spine.  These
gates are only a pale resemblance to the outer portcullis.  The bottom
of gate anchors into stone, and there is no lock on it to pick.  You will
probably need the key from around the gate master's neck.  On top of the
gate are a bunch of shrunken heads, each one impaled on a spike at the
top of the portcullis.  The heads have no ears, but the gate master has
a necklace of ears.  Coincidence?

it was once part of a lava tube that collapsed.  Rubble now blocks the

   The pattern next to you is a picture of a beautiful elven maiden dressed
in long flowing robes.  Jewels of wealth adorn her body and you almost can
hear the clinking of the chains around her neck.  The maiden is skipping
merrily through a path in the countryside.

alive, all burning without consuming any fuel.  There are the brilliant
yellows and oranges found in any campfire, the shining light of candles and
and the radiance of heated steel, as well as the blues and greens from

statues makes you think that they are just a little too realistic and that
maybe they were once alive like you.

The Art Gallery~
   Suffused light shines down from the skylight above.  The room is built
enitrely out of white marble, definatley uncommon.  Columns stretch from
the floor to the ceiling some 20 odd feet above you.  In the middle of the
ceiling is an expanse of leaded glass in a stout iron frame.  Directly
beneath the skylight is a tremendous statue standing on a pedestal of
stone.  At first you think it must be made of shattered glass, but it's
brilliance is too great, nearly blinding you.  It's made of diamonds.

The Inner Courtyard~
   You are standing in the north western corner of the courtyard.  To the
east there is an arched entryway.  The mosiac on this section of the wall
is of the samurai just entering battle. Still only on the fringes, the
the samurai has allready wetted his sword with blood and a figure in black
lies crumpled on the ground.  The faces of the two ninjas holding the maiden
have a worried expression on their faces.

   You are standing in the middle eastern wall of the courtyard.  To your
east there is a set of double doors.  The wall here shows the samurai in
the midst of fighting two of the ninjas.  The third has his wakizashi
planted deep in the maiden's back.  The samurai's face is contorted with
pain as he witnesses this, his arms raised high to the heavens.

dragon, Kairu.  He is enveloped is enveloped in flames which spread to
consume the remaining ninjas, their faces masks of agony.

The Kitchen~
   This appears to once have been a kitchen.  The remnants of a stove, if
that is what it was, lie crumbling in a corner.  The rest of the room is
littered with broken dishware and saki jars.  This room has not been used
in a long time, which makes you wonder why you smelled food coming from
this direction and what the people in this place eat.  If they need to at
all.

   When you enter this room you notice that you are in a bubble.  Out beyond
the bubble appears to be a vast expanse of water that extends in all
directions without end. The entire region is illuminated by soft light:
glowing blues and greens that seem to radiate from the water.  Ocassionaly
you see small air bubbles, small bits of earth, and even an even rarer ball
of flame.

made from exotic materials.  Gloden bowls of oil dot the walls with wicks
set in little boats of silver, providing a dim, flickering light to the
hallway.  The hallway continues to your east.

In Jail~
   Congratulations, if you are a mortal and you are reading this
You have been a complete butthead and have been stuck in jail for
it.  There is a Jailer here to keep you company and to make sure
that you are not bored while you stay.  The room is peaceful so
you can't attack anything and you will not gain hitpoints.  If
you loose your link in this room, the Jailer has been instructed
to hit you for your insolence and doing so will cause you to
loose your stuff.  So it would be advisable to stay for the given
duration.  This room will automatically teleport you back to the
temple at the end of the duration.
Gods who are not sure how to use this room should read the rules
posted in rooms 2640-2644.  There are also instructions in room 2645
for setting the teleport timing for the room.

2.  If someone tries to steal from you, ie:  you see:
    "You discover that Butthead has her hands in your wallet."
    or
    "Butthead tried to steal something from you!"
    then ask the gods for assistance in getting your stuff back
    If the thief refususes to return your stuff AND THERE ARE
    NO GODS ON, then you may gather up your friends and seek
    compensation yourself.  Otherwise the gods will be able to
    force the thief to return your stuff.  If there is no
    message like the ones stated above, then you have no right
    to kill them.  Period. No exceptions.  Also, having someone
    say that they are going to steal from you is not a good
    reason for you to kill them.

2...(continued)
    In the case that a thief steals from you and fails to get
    anything, it would be silly to demand compensation for
    nothing.  Call a god and tell the god that so-and-so tried
    to steal from you and failed.  If your story seems
    reasonable and you have a witness then the thief will be
    put in jail for a number if ticks relative to the
    number of offenses this particular thief has.
    If a player is witnessed stealing from a corpse, preferably
    by people from different calling locations, then a god
    should be notified and the god will treat it as if it were a
    thievery.  These witnesses must be present in the room when
    the corpse was robbed. If there are no witnesses, then there
    is no excusable reason to go off and kill a person in the area
    because he happens to have similar stuff.  If you do, you
    will be treated as if you were a player killer without
    reason.

    3.  In the case of player Butthead killing Innocent and taking
        all of his stuff, Innocent should shout to the gods for
        assistance.  The gods should do the following:  They should
        force Butthead to return Innocent's stuff, and in lieu
        of the usual demand by Innocent to kill Butthead, offer
        that Butthead be put in jail and fined.  The time in jail
        and the fine will depend on the number of the offense.
        These will be posted on the wall of the jail.  This should
        appease Innocent, but Innocent does not have the right to
        hunt down Butthead unless no jail time is served.
        If no jail time was served and no fine levied, then Innocent
        is within his or her rights to try and kill Butthead.  If
        Innocent fails then so be it, and perhaps Innocent shouldn't
        have tried to be so vengeful.  Butthead is not however
        covered by those rules outlined in players killing for
        self defense.

    4.  This is the last room (thank goodness).
        If Butthead decides to create/charm a bunch of followers
        (zombies, charmed guards, hill giants, etc) and then kills
        Innocent, he is guilty of player killing and should be
        handled as if Butthead had killed Innocent himself.
        If Butthead charms Innocent and gets Innocent killed,
        then Butthead should be treated as if he killed Innocent
        himself.


               ANYTHING NOT COVERED BY THESE RULES WILL
                  BE HANDLED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS
                 (Which means if you have a question)
                  (ask a god before killing anybody)

Instruction Room for Jail~
      This is the room where you figure out how to use the Jails.
The time a person must spend in jail is as follows:
You must be of an editing level to set the duration of the room.
This is done by editing the teleport function of the room.
The formula is as follows.

edit tele <time> 3001 1
time is set as follows:
300 = 1 tick
the duration of the sentence doubles with the offense.
It starts at 4 ticks. Such that first offense is 4 ticks,
second eight, third sixteen, etc.
For a 3 offense the time would be: 16 * 300 = 4800

The fine a person gets is as follows:
        10% of gold carried and or in bank, depending on which
        you can tell.
        Take the best weapon the person has away from them.

        And you fine them a number of items equal to one less than
        the offense.
Example:
If this is a person's fourth offense they get fined as follows:
40% of their gold is taken (round up)
The person's best weapon is taken
The person looses their 3 best items.

The Reception~
The room is dimly lit, the few lantern shrouded with silky screens.
Thick carpets muffle your footsteps and overstuffed pillows abound
on couches and divans.  The smell of cheap perfume is overwhelming
and shrieks, squeals, wicked laughter and other sounds of questionalbe
morality issue forth from closed doors off a narrow hallway to the
east. To the north a tiny room that appears to be some sort of shop.
Light flickers off of a small plaque mounted on the wall to your left.

Juegetes de Sexo~
   Every inch of the wall or counter space in this room is crowded with
devices and implements.  Most of which you can't figure out and don't
want to know about.  The few that you do recognize make you blush
furiously.  A sultry brunette looks at you through smoldering eyes and
asks you what you are in the market for.  This makes you blush even
harder.  A small sign on the counter lists signs and prices.

Front Porch of the DanjerHaus~
  You are on the front porch of the DanjerHaus.  The entire house is
made of brick and it has a rusting metal roof with a few chimneys
sticking out.  The vegetation seems a bit unkempt for a house in the
noble district, but the residents obviously are above catering to the
needs of their neighbors.
  Diamond Street is south of here.  The wooden front door to the north
leads into the living room.

DanjerHaus living room~
  This is the living room of the DanjerHaus.  There are windows in
most of the south wall giving you a nice view of the overgrown
shrubbery and the street.  There is a brick fireplace in the center of
the north wall. Furniture is almost nonexistent, but there is quite a
bit of musical equipment scattered about.
  To the east, through a glass-paned door, you can see a screened-in
brick porch.  The door leading to the front porch is in the west
corner of the south wall.  A comfortable TV room is to the west and a
door to the hallway is in the west end of the north wall.

East porch of the DanjerHaus~
  This is a very comfortable place to relax on a warm summer day.  The
porch is made mostly of brick with a ceiling fan in the middle of wood
roof.  The porch is screened beginning about 2' off the floor and
ending at the ceiling.  You can see Diamond Street south through the
screens.
 There are a few couches along the walls and some chairs facing the
couches.  Maybe you should have a nap?
  Through the glass paned door to the west is the living room.
Through a screen door to the north is an overgrown, narrow side yard.

  This room, like many kitchens, has linoleum floor.  There is a
closet in the east wall that used to have a fireplace, but now
contains the hot water heater and the air conditioning equipment.  A
pantry is in the east wall as well.  There are cabinets on the south
wall, a sink on the west end, and a green and a brown refrigerator on
the north and west walls respectively.
  Through a door to the south is the TV room.  Two doors in the north
end of the east and west walls lead to the hallway and the west porch
respectively.

including the floor, is covered by something.  Books, printouts, and
clothes are scattered around the room haphazardly.
  There is a messy bed in the middle of the room and a couch and chair
for visitors, although they would have to remove a few layers of junk
to sit down.  There is a rather small stereo system in the closet with
a small collection of CDs.

trees to the east with 8' shrubs screening out the view of other
houses.  There is a clearing to the north that must be the back yard.
  This place is completely overgrown with shrubs, vines and weeds and
there are only faint trails leading north to the back yard, south to
the porch and east around the porch.

garage to the southwest and a 6' fence to the west behind the trees.
  There is a door into the house to the south, but it's locked.  There
is also a trail to the east leading to the side yard and a trail to

is too.  There are tools scattered all over the place and a mostly
disassembled VW van on the west half of the concrete slab.  The
ceiling over the concrete slab is aluminum, supported by poles.  The
garage proper is closed and contains lots of furniture and probably
poisonous spiders.  The house is to the east and a wooden fence blocks
any movement west.
  A wide path leads north to the back yard.  There is a lane between
parked cars south of here that leads to the front yard.  To the east
is a brick porch with garbage cans and laundry appliances.

Haag's Throne Room~
     This grand hall dwarfs many of the castles you have seen.  Marble
columns as thick as a man is tall stretch up to meet a ceiling that seems
to crowd the stars.  A reflecting pool in the floor shows scenes too
horrific to be anything but hell itself, and you find yourself avoiding the
pool reflexively.  Doorways of a relatively normal size (for Haag that is)
on the East and West walls seem to shimmer and dance as if they were weak
spots in the fabric of space-time.  Circling the pool is a majestic spiral
staircase wide enough for a dozen men to walk abreast; it seems to lead up
right out of the world.  The most striking aspect of the room, however, is
the great throne of gold at its northern end.  Up on a dais sits a throne
that looks older than time itself, and sitting upon it is Mighty Haag,
the immortal Ard-righ of all Prydain.  The High-king watches you cooly.

characterize this imposing fortress, which can only be the legendary
Camelot.  A stout drawbridge, down at the moment, offers entrance to the
gatehouse, where you see occasional flashes of Arthur's white and gold
liveried guards. To the west you see flashes of bright colors and hear
the merriment echoing from a visiting fair.

tempting smells of a fine meal in preparation waft in from the west.
You could almost swear that you hear praying through the door to the east.
The hallway continues both to the north and south.

Muddy sewer~
You stand in a bend of the pipe system of the sewer with mud up to your

A ledge by the dark pool~
You can't see much here but the echo tells you that there's quite a drop
down. You can just make out a huge dark pool out there in the darkness,
mostly because of the trickling of water. The water from the sewer actually
washes over this ledge and makes it quite slippery. From here it drops,
like a waterfall, into the pool far down. Under you there is a small fissure
in the rock. It seems big enough to contain a few people.

You stand in a small room with a great big opening in the ceiling. From this
opening there's mud dripping down in large lumps. >YUCK<. You can smell the 
foul stench of the slimy sediment as you try not to get covered by the 
falling sludge. To the east there is an entryway leading out from here and 
it seems absolutely impossible to force the muddy decent.

Down the old well~
You are dangling on the slippery sides of the old well leading down and up.
The only secure point here is the metal bars that are cemented into the 
sides, the ones that you cling frantically to so that you don't fall. Who

   Also in this room is a dressing table and a pot filled with exotic looking
bird feathers.  The regal plummages of peacocks, parrots, barettas, and other
birds can be seen.
   A large closet is set into one wall.  However, it appears to be closed

shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-

a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the

Free fall from the Chain~
This is probably the third worst place to be in this entire MUD right now.
You fall

The Astral Plane~
   The vastness of the Astral plane engulfs you, making you feel more
like an inconsequential blemish rather than a dangerous adventurer.  To
all sides of you there is greyness. It reaches farther than the eye can
see, and farther than you will ever be able to go.  Occasionally a little
globular bit of water, a small mass of flame, or even a clod of earth
can be seen floating by.  More importantly, however, are the white,
tornado-like spouts of nothingness that are called wormholes, or the
different hued pools of color you occasionally glimpse.  For it is those
that will get you out of this vast plane.

   The vastness of the Astral plane engulfs you, making you feel more
like an inconsequential blemish rather than a dangerous adventurer.  To
all sides of you there is greyness. It reaches farther than the eye can
see, and farther than you will ever be able to go.  Occasionally a little
globular bit of water, a small mass of flame, or even a clod of earth
can be seen floating by.  More importantly, however, are the white,
tornado-like spouts of nothingness that are called wormholes, or the
different hued pools of color you occasionally glimpse.  For it is those
that will get you out of this vast plane.

The Astral Plane~
   The vastness of the Astral plane engulfs you, making you feel more
like an inconsequential blemish rather than a dangerous adventurer.  To
all sides of you there is greyness. It reaches farther than the eye can
see, and farther than you will ever be able to go.  Occasionally a little
globular bit of water, a small mass of flame, or even a clod of earth
can be seen floating by.  More importantly, however, are the white,
tornado-like spouts of nothingness that are called wormholes, or the
different hued pools of color you occasionally glimpse.  For it is those

The Astral Plane~
   The vastness of the Astral plane engulfs you, making you feel more
like an inconsequential blemish rather than a dangerous adventurer.  To
all sides of you there is greyness. It reaches farther than the eye can
see, and farther than you will ever be able to go.  Occasionally a little
globular bit of water, a small mass of flame, or even a clod of earth
can be seen floating by.  More importantly, however, are the white,
tornado-like spouts of nothingness that are called wormholes, or the
different hued pools of color you occasionally glimpse.  For it is those
that will get you out of this vast plane.

   The vastness of the Astral plane engulfs you, making you feel more
like an inconsequential blemish rather than a dangerous adventurer.  To
all sides of you there is greyness. It reaches farther than the eye can
see, and farther than you will ever be able to go.  Occasionally a little
globular bit of water, a small mass of flame, or even a clod of earth
can be seen floating by.  More importantly, however, are the white,
tornado-like spouts of nothingness that are called wormholes, or the
different hued pools of color you occasionally glimpse.  For it is those
that will get you out of this vast plane.

   You are standing on the floor of the great glacial rift.  The wind whips
snow around you in great flurries, which nearly blind you, and make it
impossible to see more than a few feet in front of you.  This is truly an
unpleasant place.

A shadowy lair~
A huge mound of snow and ice lies in front of you.  It seems to shiver
slightly in the wind.   There seems to be an odd patch of snow on the
ground below you, perhaps it is a secret door of some kind.

Several frozen carcasses line the walls, and a giant mortar and pestle, and

sized chunks, or use the mortar and pestle to grind the victim up into a
thick soup-like mixture, which they dunk pieces of ice into, like a dip.

suspect that this room might be a guard room of some sort.

An icy tunnel~
   You are in a tunnel, which bends here, leading west and north.  To the
north, you can see a fairly bright red glow, much brighter than the dim red
light you have grown accustomed to.

An Icy Cavern~
You are standing in the bedchambers of the Jarl.   The walls are littered 
with gaudy tapestries, and large, tasteless bearhides.  Fire beetle cages
litter the room in abundance, which makes the room much brighter than other
rooms that you have seem before.

An icy tunnel~
You are standing in an icy tunnel, which seems to be some sort of last ditch
escape route for the giants, if they are overrun.  It appears to be one-way
only.  If you go east, you will not be able to return to the west

A small cave~
   You are standing in a a small, dry cave, which leads southwards.  It is
not as cold here as it is outside, and there is more than enough space
for everyone.   To the south, you can faintly hear the sound of trickling
water.  Small bones and skulls lie about, but they seem years, perhaps
decades old

to the west, and seems to lead towards a large crevice to the north.  You 
can't see what is inside the crevice, though it looks like something, or 
someone is moving, since light seems to glimmer off of something inside
the crevice

of the pool, causing light and shadows to dance across the walls.  It looks
like this place is perfectly natural, with no signs that anyone has tried
to work the ice.

sturdy four-poster bed, dressed in baby blue satin sheets.  There are two
big, fluffy pillows at the head of the bed and several small pillows spread
out casually.  The mattress looks comfortably firm, and the bed is unmade...
It has been used recently.

Donation Room~
This room is new to the temple, it was created during the hard times that
had struct the city in recent decades.  Luckily for them the sultan had
been hoarding some of the basic neccesities for just such an occasion.
These days the donation room depends on the generosity of wealthy 
adventures, and a curse on any that walk in to get all.

The kitchen entrance is to the south, and two huge double doors open into
the hallway north.

A Split in the River~
The waters of the river crash down upon a rock and splits into
two bodies of water. The river you are on continues its southern
course and the new river heads off to the east. To  your west you notice
that the rocks have split and crumbled as if torn asunder by some massive
force.  It looks impossible to traverse. The River of lost souls also
continues to the north.

the go to great lengths to keep all the roads in order. Although
the taxes in New Thalos are higher then other cities in the realm
most of the money is used for the good of the people.

The Dragon Sea~
 You are on the clear blue seas of the Dragon Sea. 
 Water extends in all directions as far as the eye
 can see. Off in the distance you think you might 
 see a small dock to the west.

Gambreezzi's Frozen Food Section~
This room appears to be carved from solid ice.  In fact it reminds you
of a hollow ice cube, except you are standing in the middle of it!
Brrr...sure is cold in here.  Neatly stacked throught this chamber of
ice are row after row of frozen treats.  You can see packages, ranging
from corn and peas to spinach and okra.  Strangely enough, all of the
packages have a funny little label of a BIG GREEN Giant and they read
"Jolly Green Giant".  As you examine the massive stacks of frozen goodies,
you lose control of your appetite, and begin gobbling these tasty 
treats.  Suddenly you hear a deep voice say 'HO HO HO'.  At first you
are startled, but then you relax.  You realize this is the home of the
Jolly Green Giant.  But BEWARE, those muscles and that BIG GREEN club
mean business, so it would be wise no to anger him.

Entrance to Graecia~
You have arrived in a strange place indeed.  You are standing on the
crest of of a huge hill.  The meadow at your feet is peaceful and calm,
unlike the savage world that you are accustomed.  The meadow extends
northward to a paved road which extends beyond the range of your vision.
The view from this hill is awesome.  You have an excellent aerial view
of this strange place.  To the northeast is gigantic mountain, extending
above the clouds, that towers above the lands below.  To the northwest is
vast ocean stretching out of sight.  You can also make out a city at
the end of the great paved road to the north.  There is also an old
wooden sign which seems to mystically entice you to read it.

The Great Brick Road~
It is strange indeed to travel on such a straight and smoothly paved
road.  You notice several deeply worn grooves that seem to run parallel
to the direction of the road.  These ruts almost seem to be part of the
road design, but you know better.  To the north the road extends northward to
the great city on the horizon.  To your east you see the beginning of a
great forest that makes Mirkwood seem feeble in comparison.

On the Road to Graecia~
The road continues to the north and the city is slowly getting closer.
The forest to the east seems even more ominous.  You get the feeling
that someone is monitoring your progress.  To the west is a large
building.  As you peer at the building the architecture seems quite foreign
to you.  There are large columns with bas reliefs of great battles supporting
the roof.  You hear the sound of laughter and cheering from inside the
building.  There is also a large insignia of the arched entrance of a
huge sword.  You are overwhelmed by the feeling of safety which issues
forth from the building.

Inside the building you notice a large hole in the ceiling which
illuminates the entire room.  There is a small reflecting pool beneath
the hole which serves as a basin for the rainwater.  Inside the building
are several armored men and women talking to each other, they all stare
at you as you enter, then quickly return to the business.  Along the
walls of this building are larger pictures of fabled monsters and
fearless men fighting to the death.  You also can make out a smaller
exit to the north that seems hidden.  To the north you can hear the
the sounds of water splashing against great rocks.

The Eastern Edge of the Great Ocean~
You have arrived at the eastern edge of the Great Ocean.  There are huge
boulders scattered along the rocky coast.  As the ocean collides with
boulders you feel uneasy.  It reminds you that the strange lands in which
you have entered are filled with great mystery.  Looking out to sea you
can make out several rocky islands.  Only great legends speak of what
lies on those unexplored lands.  There are men here building sea faring
vessels, and you can see a large man directing them.  These ships are
unlike any you have seen before and they seem able to withstand the
mighty ocean unlike the rafts and canoes in which you are so familiar.

Intersection of the Great Road~
You are standing at the intersection of a paved road and a dusty trail.
The paved road goes north and south.  To the north is the city of
Graecia, and to the south the road leads into the hills.  The dusty path
goes to the east and west.  To the west, the path leads to the vast
ocean and to the east the path twists into a mysterious forest.

Gateway to Graecia~
Unlike the city of Midgaard, this city does not need any walls to
protect it.  The reputation of the Graecian soldiers is such that no
army would consider an invasion upon this fabulous city.  Beyond the
city entrance is the Main Plaza, which serves as the center of activity
for Graecia.

This is the center of activity for the town of Graecia.  You can see
artisans showing their fine works and crafts, entertainers playing their
instruments, and in a corner is a group engaged in a heated debate.
Chariots are passing through at a such rapid pace, you almost have to
actively dodge them.  To the north is the Palace and Grand Hall of the
ruler of Graecia.  To the east and west, paved roads extend throughout
the town.  As you look to the east you can see buildings built of
fine materials such as marble and obsidian, while to the west the
shadows make the road look a bit threatening.  A paved road also extends
to the south gate of town.

Grand Hall of Agamemnon~
Scholars and wise men make up the court of King Agamemnon.  You have
interupted a great debate.  As you enter the scholars recognize that you
are foreigners and hail your arrival.  King Agamemnon welcomes you to
the land of Graecia and bids you a safe journey.  He is seated on a
throne of pure gold embedded with so many jewels that the sunlight
reflected from them nearly blinds you.  You consider stealing some of
the jewels, but you realize that Agamemnon could smite you if you
angered him.  At his side, Clytemnestra, his wife, smiles
with a glint of betrayal in her eyes.  After greeting you the court
ignores you and returns to their discussion.  There are also large
columns here providing tall deep shadows and occasionally you can see a
figure dart in between them.  You realize that even the brave Agamemnon
is not without enemies and this land of Graecia is not as peaceful as it
seems.

The Dim Alley~
The paved road that you have been accustomed now takes on a different
look.  The bricks are no longer neatly laid in place, and the buildings
that you pass are progressively in worse condition.  Occassionally you
see a shadowy figure in the corner of your eyes.  Whenever you try to
catch a glimpse of the figure, it disappears into the shadows.  Your
progress to the west is blocked by a wooden wall.  You wonder why a
wooden wall is in the middle of the street, then you see some movement
behind the wall.  An arrow stikes the ground at your feet, and you
realize that that was only a warning shot.  Obviously, it would be a
good idea to leave this area quickly.

town is where the scholars and merchants live.  You can see mini
fortresses with flowing fountains and beautiful gardens latently behind
the walls of these buildings.  You would think that there would be a
crime problem in this area, but the multitude of guards in the area
suggests otherwise.  To the east is the Main Plaza and to the west the
road continues.

You have entered the grand estate of Nero.  There are fountains,
mini-colloseums, statues, and many other fine sculptures in this area.
There is a large horse seated on a throne here.  The horse prances
proudly as you enter.  For such a large estate, it seems strange that
there are not any workers scurrying around looking busy.  In fact it is
rather quiet.  Only the statues and the Horse are here to greet you.  A
man walks by and whispers that Hercules is the only worker employed by
Nero.  It must be truly a Herculean task to keep this place in order.
Paths lead in all directions into the countryside, while to the east you
can see the edges of town.

leading into an arbory and to the south the path twists into an
area overgrown with bushes and tall grass.  The area to the south looks
like it leads into a swamp.

All is quiet hear..In fact all of the sounds that you are normally
accustomed to are no longer present.  To the west you can see an area
sheltered from the elements.  It seems to be a cave of a burrow of some
sort.  A strong smell of death and decay comes from the mouth of the
cave.  The wind begins to increase in force from the west and the stench
becomes overpowering.  You realize whatever is making that horrid stench
must be a formidable creature.

feet!  To the north you now see a gate, hidden by a large tree.  You
hear another scream, then the area is overcome by great silence.  As you
get a better look of the area you also see a small stream to the west.

blank and omnious stare.  You can see corpses of several ferocious
creatures over a large fire in the center of the village.  Obviously
they know how to use their weapons quite well.  To the south you can see
a hidden trail leading a small arbory, and to the north you can see what
appears to be a combat area.

apples.  You remember that these apples were supposed to be guarded by
some horrible beast, but there seems to be no sign of him now.  As you
take a second glance at the mound you see a suspicious hole concealed by
some debris.  The hole seems to be the home of some great monster, and
judging by the scales scattered around it only one thing comes to mind.
That must be the home of a DRAGON!!!

walls and ceiling of this room don't even have the chilly coating of
ice.  That's because Gambrest is starting a frozen food collection on
the walls, and they need heat to grow before they are stored.  There
is only one exit and it leads into a shimmering green room.

a part of the ruins in much better shape.  You have a eerie sense of
danger from the north as you see shadows moving about the ruins.  To the

Lair of Medusa~
The large staircase that you were usings ends in a dark and smelly
chamber.  There are various pillars and statues here, making it
difficult to see.  The torches create spooky shadows that make you think
the place is haunted.  Suddenly, one of the statues topples over and
breaks into a dozen pieces.  A large shadow leaps from the darkness and
attacks.

Guard Room~
You have entered a small room that is used to block passage deeper into
the mountain.  There is a table here, flipped on one side.  Behind the
table are two armed men that look at you and grin evilly.  Obviously
they have heard the uproar, and they rush forward to attack.

is human carved and you can see two exits blocked by huge wooden doors
to the north and south.  The floor in this room is worn, as if there
were lot of movement in this room in the last few weeks.  As you get a
closer look at the walls, you notice that the wall to the west looks
quite odd.

Leaders Quarters~
This room is much finer than the common room.  Instead of bunks, there
are soft and comfortable beds.  There is also very lavish furniture,
indicating that some of the pirates have grow wealthy by raiding the
Graecian coast.  You surprise a middle-aged elf as you walk in and he
looks at you with fear in his eyes.  It seems that he is paralyzed with
fright.

look to the north, and the gloom that hides the secrets of Rhowyn.  A

    This is an ancient path. Rocks and boulders are strewn about, yet
the middle of the path shows signs of wear from the many travelers and
horses that have passed this way throughout millenia.  The path is dim,
and some light may be required up ahead. Fresh droppings from a
strange animal abound here.  It's tracks are not large, but instead,
seem claw-like. The trees nearby seem strange as well; almost lifelike.
There is an especially large tree to the west.

It has far too much class to have been constructed by Skexies. Items

   Any God which discovers you abusing the Challenge is empowered
to punish you in any reasonable way they see fit. The Challenge
of the Skexies is an innovative idea in mudding. It has never been
done before. Your full cooperation and honesty are required to
make the Challenge a fun and exciting area. The last three signs
are introductions to each of the three Challenge zones. Read them
carefully. Most of all, bring many healing potions with you.
Also, you needn't complete the entire challenge at one sitting
(the badges can be rented). Simply bypass the challenges you have
already completed, and continue with the first one that you need.

GOOD  LUCK!

   Players must enter each challenge room alone. The rooms are
private (i.e. One player per room), and you may not in anyway
receive help from another player. You may not attempt a challenge
unless you are in the required level range. Challenge Prizes and
badges are not tranferable, and have no monetary value. Do not attempt
to give your Challenge prizes to another player. Any such action
will cause you to lose any Challenge prize you currently have,
plus you will lose the right to complete future Challenges (if any).
To redeem your prize you must contact an Immortal with the ability
to load the prize. The prizes do not naturally exist in the game.

sign1~
     The Challenge of the Skexies is designed as an on-going
quest for people levels 10 to 50. The Challenge area is separated
into three Challenge zones. The first zone is meant for levels 10
to 20. The second for levels 20 to 40, and the last, most difficult
challenge , is meant for levels 40+. In each zone you will find 9
Challenges to be completed. After successfully completing each
challenge you will earn a badge (bronze badges for Challenge 1,
silver badges for Challenge 2, and gold badges for Challenge 3).
The badges are numbered and you must collect all the badges
(of the appropriate color) to earn the Challenge prize. There is
one prize for each class for each of the three Challenge zones
(i.e. The Warrior's prize for Challenge 3, the most difficult, is
The Purple Shard). The prizes will be well worth your risk of life.
The item you recieve _should_ be strung to your name.  If you have an
existing challenge quest item, and it has not been, ask a god to do it.

An Unused Gelfling Cave~
   This room has not been cleared of stalactites or stalagmites. The ground is
muddy and the room is especially cold. Drawings decorate the small cave area.
This room seems to get little use. A white line is drawn on the floor. Beyond
which you are not recommended to go.

Gelfling.  The cave has been decorated with an unusual rug. Braziers light
the room to a dim level. White silk covers the ceiling. Water drips from the
silk cover into a large bowl. It makes for an interesting waterfall of sorts.

  As you stare at the pile of trash, you notice that it seems to be almost 
deliberately placed, as if to hide something that was underneath.  Then you 
notice a small piece of rope, which quickly leads you to a door that has

Southern Entrance to the Gypsy Village~
The trail you have been following has become a small road. It is basically
a wide path with deep ruts carved into it from constant wagon travel. To
the north, you see a small village, made up partly of small buildings and
partly of wagon caravans. The worn road seems to run straight through the
small village, and continues past it. There is a set of makeshift gates
marking the official entrace, with a small sign posted on them.

and that is that no one can use the road to the north anymore. It is
almost as if the swamp has a purpose here. To the south, you can make

with the Lord of Ravenloft be cut, in an attempt to diminish his evil
power in this land. The High Lords of the Mages' Caravan created this
swamp as a boundry, to ensure that the wishes of the Council would be
heeded. If you are foolish enough to enter, beware, for death lies at
every turn. If you survive the pits of quicksand, you may still be 
caught for all eternity. If you somehow make it through our boundry, then
good luck at surviving the wrath of the Lord of Ravenloft.

wear and tear.  The guardians aren't too happy to see you.  There are doors
in both the east and west walls.  The west goes towards a drow outpost and
the east seems to slope downwards.

contained within. It is obvious that the forces captured here will dissipate

Zyx's Tower Room~
     The floor of this large round room is covered by a Persian rug of
intricate design.  An elaborate brass table sits in the center of the room,
and a comfortable divan invites you to rest.  Airy windows look out upon a
large Persian palace and a vast expanse of desert stretching off as far as
the eye can see.  A breeze blows through the windows, making this room an
island of pleasant shade in a sea of blazing heat.  A small fountain built
into the wall provides relief for your thirst.  Sitting on the table is a
beautifully enameled bottle, and a vaporous form in the shape of a large
muscled man floats above it.  The djinn awaits Zyx's command.
     There are four glowing rectangles on the walls, one in each of the
cardinal directions. The surfaces of each shimmer throughout the spectrum,
betraying the harnessed magical energies contained within. A small stairwell
descends to one side, and a hole in the ceiling permits a brass circular
stair to ascend far into the clouds above.

Brutus's Torture Chamber~
    As you enter this black, brick-lined room, you immediately notice the 
astounding number of torture devices lining the walls as well as numerous red
stains which scrubbing can't remove.  Glancing around quickly, you see an iron
maiden,thumb screws, a stretching rack, and a whipping post before you shudder
and attempt to regain your composure.  Each is meticulously numbered and 
polished to a shine.  In the southeast corner of the room is a cozy little 
forge for heating various implements designed for Brutus's amusement and 
certainly not yours.  The only light comes from a 150-watt bulb swinging 
pendulum-like on a long wire from the ceiling.  In the North-West corner
of the room there is a large desk made completely out of different human 
bones.  Interestingly enough, you also observe a IN/OUT plastic filer on top
of the desk.
    There is only one window and whilst considering a quick exit, you notice
that a long, wooden plank extends out from it into the cloud-filled sky.

and eastwards into the city of Mordilnia.  The forest here is very
quiet, and it looks like this road is not often travelled

with a strong iron gate in between; wicked, barbed spikes protruding up and
down along every other bar - like the hungry jaws of some demented 
nether-beast.
   Temple Road runs north and south from here, its dull, cobbled surface
visually muted by the windblown dust which forms a thin line over its flat
surface.  Eastward, you see the Temple of Mordilnia, in all its modest and
holy splendor.

feet have tread its surface, both bare and shod.  The high-domed ceiling
shows a sky of many shades and hues.
   Midway from floor to ceiling, a balcony-like second floor stands, hand
woven tapestries adorning the smooth granite walls.  From here to the floor
above, a grand, spiralling stairway ascends, its polished cherrywood surface
casting a multitude of tiny daggers of reflected light into your eyes.
   Through the arched portal to the west, one can venture to Temple Road,
and the MidWest Gate, leading far out through the wilderlands.

Turning to look, you see a majestic, gargantuan tree...certainly the largest
oak you've ever seen in a largely populated area.  It's singularity seems to
make it some sort of symbolic presence, like a talisman of ultimate nature
grasped cruelly in the stony talons of society.
   The road continues from here, both to the north and the south.

the center of Mordilnia, and a bit past it.
   The sounds of a forge can be heard nearby, and you wince at the deafening
revertebrations of the hammer as it meets the anvil, sending a ringing sound
through the streets, a sound not unlike that of heavy weaponry clashing
furiously in battle.

surrounding Mordilnia, with a strong, steel frame stairway leading up to the
front door of the establishment.
   Though the cobbled stone street here is shadowed by the building above it,
the stones have an almost supernatural polished gleam to them, as if
advertising the wares bought and sold daily just atop the stair...

stone, some of which has been worked loose over the years.  A large

cauldron of cool, steel-quenching water lies in the center of the room,

   Diamond Street leads west from here, Blackraven Avenue leads east, and

surface in the past.  The building is illuminated by many small candles
hanging from oaken pillars, giving the room a warm, cheery glow.  Many

and lovely craft.  Vast, almost limitless tomes containing holy knowledge
fill countless shelves, as well as statuettes depicting deities of every
pantheon and creed.
   At the front of the shop, for that is the true purpose of this otherwise
saintly abode, sits a small, mahogany desk scarred by many years of loving
use by quill and scroll.

At the southern edge of the stage, you see a podium, its ebony surface a
grim testament to the death which has been dealt here.
   In the center of the wooden stage, a guillotine stands, solemnly waiting
for its wicked blade to bite into flesh and bone.  Spectators of past
decapitations have always gasped at the meaty thump of a severed head
falling into the blood-lined interior of the bucket below.
   East of here, you see Phantom Road.  East Avenue runs south into South

the Town Common to the west.

past loungings, such as soft indentations in the grass where someone has
briefly taken seat for lunch or small talk.  Small, wild flowers grow in
dense, well-distributed patches throughout the common, giving you a picture
of simplistic beauty.
   A great, towering oak resides west of here, shading that part of the
common and providing an adequate place of slumber.  The only irony to these
sights is the existance of the sadistic tool of death just east of here, a
great chopping block for those of unruly nature.

At The Great Oak~
   You stand at the thick base of the gargantuan Great Oak.  Its trunk is as
thick as any building in Mordilnia, a testimony to its great age.  None of the
inhabitants know how or why it is here, but some have guessed that it was
planted millennia ago by a wisened race of Druidic creatures, as a legacy of
their passing, and some traveller set up camp at its base, eventually deciding
to stay, building Mordilnia as a whole around this central figurehead of
nature and beauty.  No one has dared bring blade against this tree, for some
unspoken law, or perhaps a Druidic ritual, has forbade it.
   The Town Common lies east of here, shaded by the branches of the oak, while
the Temple Road is to the west.

boots.  Shelves line the walls here, lined and neatly packed with a great
multitude of adventuring equipment; from bags to torches, and beyond.

In Front of the Villa~
   You stand in the front yard of this lavish courtyard.  There is a
beautiful marble fountain of a dragon with water flowing from its mouth,
positioned in the center of the walkway.  Large apple and orange trees line
the sides of the building as you look at it, giving you a sense of peaceful
splendor.
   The fresh-cut lawn and exotic flowers show you that the owner of this
place has much wealth.
   Northward, through the marble support columns, is a large double door.

Wizard Way~

the inhabitants.  The cobblestone road leads north, eventually out of town,
and south, into the Town Square and beyond.

Wizard Way~
   Here at the northernmost sector of town, you can still hear the sounds of
the wilderness, mixed in with the more familiar bustlings of civilization.
   To the north, a gate leads out of town, into the wilderness, and 
southward, the road continues.

is farther north.  Either side of the road here is surrounded by thick
shrubbery, which starts here and extends southward until it reaches the walls

Blackraven Avenue~

town square, and west to an eventual dead end.  Clouds of dust float close
to the ground here, touching down on the cobbled stone street and lifting off
again with the changes in the wind.
   To the northwest, you see an alchemy shop.  The faint scent of sulphur and
exotic spices wrestle with your sense of smell.

Blackraven Avenue~
   Here, the scents of chemical and spice are nearly overpowering, and your
hair at the base of your neck stands on end with the strong magical energy
that is pulsating through the atmosphere.  Some sort of hallucigenic residue
floats through the air here, for your vision blurs and colors change; from
magenta to fuscia, to every visible color imaginable.
   The sign of the shop to the north seems to waver and dance writhingly, and
the cobbled stones beneath your feet seem to shift restlessly, as if they
were tiny, sentient beings, set on carrying your weight with only their sheer
size in numbers.  Then a fresh wind tugs at your face and through your hair,
and all is normal in the world once again.

and to the immediate west you see a spiralling cloud of multicolored gases,
just it front of the Alchemy Shop.  The source of these gases seems to be
a ventillation pipe leading from the roof of the establishment.  Here, it is

The House of Supreme Alchemy~
   As you stand in this dim, musty room, you discover that the cloying
smells of exotic spices and strange chemicals are not as strong as they are
out on the street.  In fact, this doesn't look to be a laboratory of any
sort, so the room where the various potions and other oddities are made must
be located in the back somewhere, with a ventillation shaft extanding above
the shop.
   Here, you see strange, arcane symbols attached to the walls here and there
along with shelves full of bottled liquids and jarred powders.  A large,
stone-carved counter lies in the center of the room, with neatly stacked
papers and other secretarial paraphanelia lining its top.
   To the south, you see the street.

marble columns as big around as an average sized tree hold up the ceiling
above your head, so beautiful and yet so stonily strong and cold.

   Instruments of the thieving trade line the walls and rest upon tables

toys for trainees.  All is quiet here, as is the way of the silent and

edged swords and serrated blades, as well as huge axes of war and weapons
designed to literally crush the life out of one's opponent are carefully,
and almost lovingly cleaned and displayed in museum-fasion in glass cases
and velvet-lined chests.  Large, bulky suits of armor rest on quilted tables
and crates, as well as some that have been put up on display.
   The room is strangely clean, though that is due to the fact that if it
were not, weapons and armor both would go to ruin in a dry heap of crimson
rust and corrosion.

At The Altar~
   You stand before a stunningly white altar make of shimmering, polished
marble.  Tapestries of long ago arorn the walls here, casting long shadows
on the walls where they are positioned.  Looking over the balcony, you feel
an extremely vivid rush of vertigo as you see the temple floor below.
   The mahogany staircase leads downward, while bright rays of multicolored
light flit playfully from its surface, reflected from the sunlight that floats
down through the stained glass dome above.

The Road to Mordilnia~
   Just outside of the canopy of trees, your feet trod upon an ages old road,
unpaved and eroded, leading south into the town of Mordilnia.  Perhaps the
sign at the bridge is obsolete, for you see no sign of the bandits it warned
of, not even an old footprint.

A path through a murky forest~
   There is an ominous whistling as the wind whips through the dead trees
here.  Though they sport no leaves, the trees completely block out the sky
as their branches interlock.  You neither see or hear any wildlife in this
area, giving you the feeling that all is not well.  The path leads north, to
a stone bridge, and west through the forest.

The stone bridge~
   You are standing on the crumbling remains of an ancient stone bridge, 
which spans the width of a wide but shallow stream.  The forest around you
sways in unison with the breeze which pulls through your hair and clothing.
   An ancient, weathered sign has been posted by the bridge.

A trail through the light forest~
   You stand at the beginning of a long path leading out of the forest, and
eventually to the city of Mordilnia.  A gentle, but chilling breeze blows
through the dark, heavy oaks which border the path, casting their sinister
shadows over everything around.  The path continues southward, over a bridge,
then curves toward the west.

The Southern Boundary of Midgaard~
   You are in a green and fair valley amidst the gently murmuring oaks. The
sun shines gently through the trees sending dancing, golden beams rippling
across the shadowy grass while midges dance between the branches. A path
leads southward, to a bridge and beyond, while civilization can be found to
the north.

crosses the river to the north.  Looking east you can manage to see over the
walls of Midgaard and into the city.  South of here the road becomes little
more than a path as it heads down into a valley.

A decaying bridge~
   You have reached the remains of a bridge crossing the River of Midgaard.
From here you can look upstream toward Midgaard and see where the river
emerges from under the city wall.  The water, cold and dark, rushes through
the narrow channel created by the bridge and the large stones that have
fallen from the pilings.  The wood looks rotted and groans loudly with
every step.  On the south side of the bridge the road rises suddenly up a
steep bank.

The Cavernous Lair of The Mighty Skylar~
   You stand within the dark recesses of a gargantuan, sinister cavern of
immense proportions.  The very size of the place seems to create a darkness
which devours nearly all light which is cast at its gloom.  Cold, stale air
floats trough the air, its dead, sterile taste making you have thoughts of
ancient, dusty-dry tombs.
   Huge stalagmites and stalactites protrude from the floor and ceiling of
the cavern, formed over millennia by the constant, miniscule trickle of chill,
stagnant water from a source far up on the surface lands.  In the distance, the
roar of a mighty waterfall can be heard, though it can not be seen from here,
its chilling mists somehow grasp hold of your flesh, like dead, clammy hands,
even from this distance.  You can feel an ancient, omnipotent power at work
here.  It is not one of evil, or even that of good.  It is a power known
throughout the ages, yet forgotten, or cast aside, like a bane of ill tidings.

     Mahatma, that silly thief, is here, and he steals everything you
have.  He says, "Here, have a quick trip to the Temple of Midgaard."
He plugs a black dagger into your back...

     You can still bail out since your knees are shaking from the
anticipation (or is it fear?).  The sky is clear on this strand of 
web, surprisingly unsticky.  The strand does not vibrate like the 
others.  A few ballooning spiders pass by, cackling "You're gonna

The Lair of Arachnos~
     This is the lair of the Empress Spider, Arachnos.  A lavishly
adorned rainbow web, her lair allows her to move to any universe 
she wishes by using her magical strands to the Prime Material Plane.
Coffers upon coffers of gold, magical jewels and gems await.  Unfor-
tunately Arachnos is a baggy spider too, and webs all her treasures 
to her beautiful silken body.

Now after many years only the things that aren't of much use lie
here under a thick layer of dust. There is a fireplace in the

On a Road~
   The road turns here and leads south and west. To the north the
city wall lies in complete ruin and all the city which was beyond it
is now just wasteland. You get a strange sense of fear as you get
closer to the wall. There is a path leading northwards through the 
rubble.

caused you to start wondering; who could have built this road? how long ago?
what great cities did it connect? The answers must have been lost to modern
lore, or surely in your travels you would have heard some rumor of this place.
The road marches on through the hills, flat, straight, north and south.

of which has a radius of at least thirty feet. It size permits the light to
extend for some distance into the tunnel - you can see that the road continues

    After the easy walk on the ancient road it takes you a little time to get
used to the rough going on this winding trail. The grass and brush has had more
success reclaiming its territory here than it did there, and you find yourself
having to push the vegatation aside at times to get through. The trail is
continually rising, and you find yourself nearer to the mountains to the south
in elevation, if not in actual distance. The track continues east and west.

Path End~

must have used it aeons ago. You are on top of a particularly tall hill, one
that gives an excellent view of the grassy plains and desert below. Far to
the north you see a glint of blue that can only be the ocean. It is there the
road must have been headed. There is an area of scorched earth here that has
withstood all the wind and rains, from an uncountable number of campfires kept
by the watchmen who once stayed here. The winding path leads back down the
hill to the east.

straight white line that the ancient road makes through the landscape. Far in
the distance to the north you can see a blue expanse that must be an ocean,
while nearer it turns into a sea of green, which extends to the east to the
edge of your vision. To the north-west you can see the desert, an you think
you can just see the outlines of a triangular structure in the center. To the
north the sheer faces of the cliffs are now very close, and the trail seems
to be taking you right to them.

A Rocky Precipice~
    The trail you've been following ends here on a wide ledge. Long ago, it
must have been lookout used to view the world below. The mountains rise
straight above you, the sheer rock face forming an impassable barrier to
further travel in that direction. To the west you can see a fissure in the
rock; one that is deep enough that you can't see how far it extends. You know
better than to try to get there from here, though, as it would involve scaling
the mountain going west for more than twenty feet, and you'd never make it. The
steep trail heads back down the mountain here, giving you an exit.

An Opening in the Sheer Rock Face~
    As you grasp the rock you look into a fissure that extends several feet
into the face, getting deeper as it continues up the mountain. Looking out
from the fissure reveals a rocky precipice you could probably reach if you had
wings, but certainly not without. It is very cool in here, as the sun rarely
reaches the recesses of this crack. You figure you can work your way up the
fissure to leave. No other exits are apparent.

here you can see both a dark recess in the rock where the crack deepens and
down to an area where there's a little more space. It is quite cool here, and
if it weren't for the fact that you are wedged between a rock and a hard place,
you might even be comfortable.

becomes too narrow for further passage. It also tightens to the south, leaving
you in what is effectively a pocket in the fissure. The rough stone presses
against you on the east and west. You can leave to the north.

Natural Cave~
    You have entered a natural cavern, formed by the forces of nature over
time. Moving the rock aside stirred the dust like opening a tomb - looks like
no one has entered this cavern in ages, if anyone has ever been here at all.
The cave is completely dark aside from your light, the stalagmites cast strange
shadows on the walls around you. In one corner of the room you notice a hole
in the floor of the cave. Extending your light into it reveals it to be leading
into a space whose size is impossible to tell - the floor and walls, if any,
are beyond the range of your light.

East End of the Enormous Cavern~
    The easterm wall of the cavern is visible from here, and as it curves up
to the cavern ceiling which must be somewhere above, you see a tremendous black
mass of life coating it like wet and running black paint. This cavern is the
home of hundreds of bats. It is unclear what kind. Realizing this, it is with
some apprehension you tiptoe out of here.

Northeast End of the Enormous Cavern~
    This is the northwest end of an enormous cavern. The rocks here are quite
beatiful, and there is a glow coming from an extension of the cavern that
continues to the north. Despite the richness of the minerals apparent in the
walls here, there is no sign they have ever been mined. Perhaps someday when
you have the time you will return to work the rock. In the meantime, you can go
south and west to other parts of the cavern, or north to the extended cave.

North End of the Enormous Cavern~
    This is the northern end of a rather large natural cavern. The floor is
smoother here than other parts of the cave, for some reason. The roof is
visible only close to the north wall, as it arches out of sight quite quickly.
What you can see of it appears to be moving. Very odd. From the blackness of
whatever it is that is up there, you think it might be bats. Of course, that
would mean there are lots of them. As this occurs to you, it also strikes you
that it might be a good idea to leave. Like, now.

the east on the northern side, but is straighter to the south. There is a
passage sloping slightly down to the west. You notice the floor is smoother
here than one might expect for a natural cave, but you see no signs of work
done on it by intelligent creatures. You can go in all directions from here,
the cavern is to the north, south and east, the passage is west.

not to wake them. There is a tunnel that once was probably an underground
riverbed sloping gently up to the south. No water flows there now, however, and
the air is dry and musty, if anything. You can also go north and east to other
parts of the cavern.

    The glow you saw from the main cavern seems to be coming from some strange
lichen growing on the walls. They are not the only life form present here, as
you also see molds and spores of various kinds growing in between the rocks.
Unlike the main cavern, this place is damp. A trickle of water off the south
wall reveals the source of life for these humble life forms. There is a pretty

in the middle of the passage, from which you surmise this was once the route
followed by an underground river. The cavern you were just in must have served
as a natural reservior at some point, though it's hard to say how long the
area's been dry. The passage continues north and south from here.

Fork in the Riveroute~
    You've come to a place where the river must have been fed by two sources
which merged into a single stream. The southern route was clearly the larger
of the two sources, as the tunnel there is only slightly smaller than the one
into which the two sources converge to the north. The other source looks
like it probably was a minor tributary, as the hole through which it enters
this tunnel is barely large enough to fit through. It leads up and to the
west.

Route Bend~
    This is a narrow spot in a tunnel that was once the bed of an underground
stream. The passage makes a turn here from heading east-west to going pretty
much straight down into a narrow crack. Something seems to have made its home
here in the years that have passed, as there are bits of broken junk and
shattered bones strewn about the floor. You have a slightly uneasy feeling, and
have a strong urge to leave, either to the west, or down.

somewhere. There are also signs that someone might have been this way before
you, though from the bits of metal scrapings you noticed on the rocks it's
impossible to tell how long ago.

    The stream bed continues its twisting course here, only now instead of
being merely steep, it continues practically straight up to the north, and
drops sharply down to the east. There is a frayed rope ladder hanging down
on the northern wall which disappears into the inky blackness above. It doesn't
look trustworthy, but the rock is sufficiently rough for you to climb without
it's help. Getting down might be a bit more difficult, though.

    The stream bed curves again here, leading to the south and east. There are
signs that this path might have been traveled once upon a time, as along the

of some kind of metal, fastened securely to the rock. The stream bed slopes up

    The stream bed is larger here than elsewhere, and forms more of a large

apparent; one is the path the stream once followed sloping down to the west,
the other is a hole in the ceiling. You can just reach the roof to access it,
but going that way means some tough traveling, as it is essentially a shaft
leading straight up.

Vertical Shaft~
    You are climbing the wall of what was once an underground waterfall - and
quite a fall it must have been too, as the ground is dropping away below you
at an alarming rate. Traveling here is rough going, as you are forced to use
your hands to brace yourself against the rock and slide up or down on the
opposite side of the shaft with your backside. Fortunately, your armor is
taking more of a beating than you are. The top of the shaft isn't visible from
here, but you think you can see an end downwards, some thirty feet below.

is some friction with the rock to keep you from plunging down the shaft to
meet your death on whatever lies below. From above you there is a faint light
visible. The shaft twists around a corner just ahead, however, so it's not
clear what the source is. You can go up or further down into the shaft.

The Funnel~
    This is a natural sinkhole - a place where the spring meltoff from the

flows, and the funnel leads down into a very dark and forbidding looking hole.
>From here you can see what appears to be a small natural dam to the north,
over which you can see an icy pool. It looks a bit cool for bathing. To the
west lies the edge of the funnel where you can get out, south and east are
mountain walls that prevent passage in that direction.

pool. When the pool fills, the overflow goes over a small natural dam on the
south end of the pool into the funnel just south of it. You can go south to
the edge of the funnel from here, and also east for a dip in the pool.

rocks thousands of feet below. From here you can see a running stream a few
hundred feet down the cliff face to the east, where it disappears into another
crevice in the rock on its path to unknown destinations. From the lay of the
land about you it doesn't take long to figure out that the water flowing there
once flowed here, thus explaining the dry bed you've been following. The only
exit for those without wings (or the equivalent) is back down into the rock
face.

At the Bottom of a Dark Lake~
    This is the deepest part of an underground lake. As you swim about, you
can just make out the lake bottom some twenty or so feet below you. The water
is fairly muddy, which makes it difficult to maintain your sense of direction.
It looks like the lake continues to the south and north, and going up will take
you to the surface. Some blind lake fish swim about here, shying away from your
light as you approach. There is a slight current here pulling you to the north,
and you notice the lake water warms slightly to the south.

At the Bottom of a Dark Lake~
    This is the southwest end of an underground lake. The bottom is muddy and
the visibility is very low. The blind fish swimming about don't seem to mind
that very much, but they don't like your light, and they do their best to stay
away from it. There is a slow current pulling you to the north, but you can
also go east, where the water is slightly warmer. going up will take you to the
lake surface.

At the Bottom of a Dark Lake~
    You are at the southeast end of of an underground lake. The water is quite
murky, and the lake bottom is coated in a sticky mud. Fortunately, you are
swimming above lake floor. There are a variety of underwater life forms here,
mostly blind, that shy away from your painfully bright light. There is a slow
current here, pulling you to the west. You can go north and west to other parts
of the lake, up to the lake surface and you can just make out a dark hole to
the south as well. You notice the fish and other residents of the lake don't
seem to have much interest in entering this hole. There seems to be a flow of
warmer water from that direction, which might explain why the lake's relative
warmth.

An Underwater Cave~
    Perhaps coming in here wasn't such a good idea. The temperature of the
water in what has turned out to be a small underwater cave is a few degrees
warmer than the chillier water of the lake proper. Perhaps that is why some
rather large and nasty predators have taken this to be their home. Unlike the
lake bottom, the underwater cave is rocky, and along the floor you can make
out a layer of bones whose depth isn't easily determinable. There is a crack
in the south wall out of which the warmer water flows, but it is too small for
passage. If you survive, you can exit to the north.

On the Shore of the Dark Lake~
    You are on the shore of a dark underground lake, which stretches away from
you to the east. The cavern that houses it is large, but your light source
shows you its limits, and there are no apparent exits other that a wide tunnel
that lies further up the rocky shore to the west. There are a few signs that
others have stood where you are now - a bit of broken bone here and a scrap of
metal there. Perhaps this lake is used as a source of water for someone. The
tunnel to the west beckons invitingly to satisfy your curiousity.

In an Underground Stream~
    You have been swept along into what is apparently an underground stream.
Back to the west you can see the two sources of the stream, a large hole on the
one side out of which icy water shoots at terrific speed and a smaller crack on
the other side out of which warmer water is emitted more slowly. You could
probably get into the smaller crack, but the force of the current out of the
larger makes travel through it impossible. The current is pulling you to the
east, where the stream twists down and narrows.

Flying Above a Deep Chasm~
    You are flying above a deep chasm in the middle of a vast mountain range.
The wind is very strong here, and it is cold. You make every effort to stay
next to the face of the cliff from which you emerged, as even with your
flying ability you would be buffeted by the winds to destinations unplanned
if you were to move away from it. You can see a small stream running into a
wide crevice in the rock down to the east, and above you to the west is a
smaller hole in the cliff face.

On the Dark Lake~
    The water ripples as you swim on the surface of this underground lake. It
is difficult to tell how deep the water is from here, as it is very dark and
murky. To the west you can see a small area where it is possible to get up on
the lake shore. The cavern in which the lake lies is largish, but rises sharply
up from the water line in all directions but the west. From here you can exit
west to the lake shore, or, if you can breathe water, down into the depths.

Old River Passage~
    The ground slopes down slightly here, and the tunnel floor is covered with
silt and gritty sand - rock ground to bits ages ago by the flow of rushing
water. The old river tunnel carves its way through the rock to the west here;
to the east it opens up - must be a cavern. It's impossible to tell how large
it is from here. The dry river bed is quite wide - several persons could walk
side by side here comfortably. It doesn't look like the diameter changes much
to the west.

going straight in that direction with a gentle slope for as far as your light
source allows you to see. The air is dry here, but isn't musty - this place
apparently gets ventilated from time to time. That implies an exit must be
somewhere nearby.

rises out of sight at a prohibitive angle - you are going to have to do a bit
of climbing if you continue in that direction. The air is hot here, but not

exited. The breeze is welcome, as the temperature here is surprisingly hot.

horizon in that direction. The old river passage is wide here, as it cuts
through soft limestone, which chips away when you poke it. Though the exit
is still some distance away, there is a lot of heat coming from that
direction, as well as a warm breeze. The tunnel continues to the east up a
slight slope as well.

at a slight grade and goes as far as the sunlight coming through the tunnel
entrance will tell you. There is a light breeze coming from the exit to the

probably one of the major sources for the mighty river that cut it's way
through the soft earth. The chasm walls tower above you to the east and west,
while the river bed extends to the north and south. The sun tears into your
skin, the heat here is blistering! Perhaps you should take cover in the tunnel
to the east. You can also go south along the dry river bed.

dry river bed is excruciatingly hot. It isn't hard to see why, either, as the
white sand along on the river bed reflects the sunlight back off the cliffs
that rise above you to the east and west. The breeze you had noticed before
has disappeared as mysteriously as it came, leaving the area in a sweltering
calm. This place is even hot at night! You can exit north and south along the
river bed.

    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still in very good shape here, as the
elements have not been able to abuse it as they have where it is exposed to the
open sky. You have entered the arching tunnel mouth, which towers above your
head impressively. It is still possible to see here, from the light coming in
through the tunnel entrance. The road continues straight and level into the
heart of the mountains; no end is visible from here, as it is shrouded in
darkness a few hundred feet beyond your current position.

Spider Cave~
    This might have been a troglodyte cave at one time, but it is currently
inhabited by a couple of really hungry looking cave spiders. It's hard to read
their expressions, but they seem to be looking at you in a manner that implies
you are going to be lunch. You notice a lot of broken bones on the floor here,
and there are some partially drained troglodyte corpses up in the webbing that
is suspended from the ceiling.~

    You have entered a small, smelly cave. There are bits of junk scattered
about the dirty floor, personal things of the cave's occupant - a large and
particularly evil looking troglodyte. The conditions he is living in are
pitiful, and you turn your nose in disgust at the remains of a rotted tunnel
rat that he discards as you enter. Looks like he's found a more appetizing
meal.

    This cave is really nothing more than a slightly larger tunnel than most,
but it serves as an outpost for several troglodyte watchmen, who don't seem to
think much of your visit. They don't like your light very much. In fact, from
their behavior you might even think they don't like you!

    You seem to have stumbled upon an outpost of the troglodyes that live in
this region. In fact, from the sounds and glimpses to movement you see to the
west, you might have stumbled upon a troglodtye settlement. There are several
large troglodyes here will be glad to show you around. Well, they might be
willing to at least carry bits of you around, after they're done taking you
apart.

    This cave is apparently home to a bunch of real slobs. Not surprisingly,
it is adolescent troglodytes that live here. There are pieces of broken bone
and little bits of metal and glass scattered about the floor, as well as the
"valuables" of the cave's residents. You can hear the sounds of metal hitting
metal coming from the north, and there are also exits to the west and east.

    This cave is clearly a practice area for young troglodytes to hone their
skills of maiming and killing. The cave wall is an impressive dark brown -
dried blood from the less successful of those tutored here. Apparently they
play-fight awfully rough. The broken weapons and scraps of armor lying about
testify to this fact as well. There are exits to the south and west.

    Mmm, you can smell some delicious tunnel rat stewing here, a cave that is
quite apparently the cooking area for the troglodytes living around here.
There are a few pots and pans here, though they are barely recognizable as
such. The small fire under the pot from which that yummy rat smell is being
emitted is barely enough to see by, but you can detect some troglodyte matrons
slaving over the cookery. They seem to think you'd make a nice addition to the
meal they're preparing. There is an exit to the south, and you hear what might
be the clatter of weapons coming from the east.

    It's yet another troglodyte strongpoint. From the density of these things,
you'd have to think the troglodyte people were constantly under attack. Who
could be invading their homeland? You realize it's probably adventurers like
you they guard themselves against. The cave is large and has three exits, one
each to the north, south, and east. There is a funny, slightly unpleasant smell
coming from the north.

branches out further to the north. It is likely that you have found the
beginning of the main troglodyte community, as they are quite numerous here.
>From their reaction to you, you'd think they are of the opinion you are
invading their privacy or something. There are two exits - east back into the
tunnels, and west, deeper into the caves.

    You are in the southeasternmost arc of a large cave shaped approximately
like a donut, with an extremely large column in the center of the cavern. The
diameter of the column, you estimate, is probably about two-thirds of that of
the cave itself. It makes for a very strange tunnel-like effect, but it looks
natural though you have no idea what force of nature might have caused it.
This is where the troglodytes hone their weapons and repair their armor. From
the looks of things, it appears as if it's a skill they've been working on for
some time; though their tools are limited their armor and weapons are in
excellent shape. Maybe the Repair Guy had some troglodyte blood, who knows?
As you enter the cave, the many troglodytes working in here eye your armor and
weapons appreciatively.

    This is the northeastern cave of a linked set of four caves, which could
also be characterized as a single cave with an awfully big column in the
center.  From what you can tell, the cave is shaped more or less like a big
donut. In this section of the cave, female troglodytes are working on
extracting those vital vitamins and minerals from recent kills, by crushing
the bones into a powder which gets mixed into an occasional meal. There are
a couple of young trogs running around here, annoying those working. All this
activity ceases when you enter, and they turn to the task of defending their
home. In addition to the exits along the cave to the west and south, there is
also a passage leading north.

entirely unlit normally, and the presence of your light source appears to be
the brightest thing some of the little trogs have ever seen. Again, it strikes
you that you might be trespassing. There is a larger cave off to the south,
and there are also cavern to the north and west.

    This is a smaller cave than any of the others in this area. It appears to
be a hidden twin strongpoint to the one directly east of here, from which the
cave you are currently in is not clearly visible. Ordinarily, this position
would be occupied by troglodytes watching over the other strongpoint to the
east, preparing to reinforce them in case of any trouble.

cleaned with a toothbrush... even the dirt on the cave floor looks clean. The
rocks are shiny and sparkle at you, hinting at worth in their glittering

    This large cave is the sleeping quarters of most of the male troglodytes,
a fact that is evinced more than anything by the bad smell and the large mess.
How so many creatures who don't believe in bathing could live together in one
room is beyond comprehension. Perhaps troglodyes have no sense of smell. This
place is such a mess, you imagine they must have bad vision, too, to tolerate
it. The cave is normally occupied by a few troglodyte soldiers, catching a nap
between guard duties.

    The cave you are in resembles a tunnel more than anything, and might be
labeled as such if it weren't so wide. In fact, though, you are in a cavern
with an extremely large column of natural stone in the middle, which blocks
the view of the other side of the cavern from your current position. This part
of the cave is a practice area for adult troglodytes, as there are scraps of
metal and wood scattered about the floor in silent testimony to past rites of
supremacy that determine the clan chief. There are exits to the north, south,
and east.

    You are now in the northwest arc of a large, donut shaped cave. This is
likely the place where the soldiers work out ther strategy and formations, as
you can see a bunch of rocks set on a stone "table" (really just a large, flat
rock), ostensibly the staging grounds for mock battles and strategic plots by
troglodytes here for many a year, given how smooth the top has now been worn.
There are also several crude drawings on the wall, though what they are of, it
is hard to say for sure. The cave continues to the south and east, and there
are also passageways leading to the west and north.

    This is the chief's "private" cave. Apparently being the leader of these
people has some priveledges, at least. The caves furnishings are only slightly
more ornate here than anywhere else, though, so apparently the job isn't
exactly loaded with perks. The chief is here, talking with his top fighters
about prospects of battle. They turn to you, knowing now the battle they had
been anticipating is already upon them. There is an exit to the east.

guests. There is a large case filled with trophies from past victories of the
troglodyte clan. Among the trophies, you spot a battered Golden Shield, the
skull of a cave fisher, with some dents and a big hole just over the right
eye, a small crystal sphere, and dull grey helmet with a plume that was once
probably white. The mementos here range from the unexpected to the astounding.
You are impressed by the ability of such a seemingly limited people to have
defeated such a large and varied set of opponents. You can exit east~

    The end of the mountain trail is evident to your west from here; the trail
drops steeply and the ground turns greener, as the elevation isn't sufficient
to maintain the ice and snow of the higher ground. A freezing wind blows down
the mountains through which this trail winds, and it makes you shiver in your
boots. The mountain trail leads to the south from here up and up again the
mountain heights. You can also go west to more moderate climes.

    The trail turns again here, as it makes its way up and around the peaks
the have started to appear around you in all directions. Though the path
doesn't assault any actual peaks, you notice that the elevation here is
significantly higher than it is to the north, and it rises even further as it
continues it's journey to the east, since it moves of the valley floor up
along the side of a mountain. Up until now, the snow that has been adorning
the mountains was higher up, but you have come to the point where the trail
winds through the snow. Still, it is compact enough to permit travel, though
the way is a bit slipperier.

    It is bitterly cold here. The snow on the path is about ankle deep here,
and it's fresh, which makes traveling on it a bit of a trial. The path is now
making its way along a mountainside, rather than trying to slither between the
peaks at their bases. As a result, to the south there is an impressive drop to
the valley floor far below. Fortunately, the path is wide enough to afford
easy travel without worrying about slipping to one's death below. The grade is
quite steep going up to the east, though to the west the trail leaves the
mountainside on it's way down to warmer places. An icy wind blows from the
southeast, chilling you to the bone.

    The trail curves along the side of a mountain here, leading to the west
and south; ever rising to the south, dropping to the west. Across a valley far
below you, you can see lesser peaks to the north. You are above them, and you
can see they are just below the constant cloudline that glooms menacingly on
the trail leading south into the mountains above you. The snow is still
shallow enough here for reasonable travel, though it is fresh, and your feet
sink into up to the top of your ankles. Unfortunately, it looks as if it only
gets deeper to the south, where the trail rises further. The wind is strong
here, and it claws at your clothing, penetrating it to make you long for warmer
climes.

    Your ears pop, and it is difficult to breathe normally here, as the
elevation makes for a scarcity of oxygen in the atmosphere. You hope to leave
this place soon, as the elements are starting to wear on you. It is snowing
lightly here, and the fresh snow on the ground makes travel difficult, as each
step is a labor in which you submerge your feet into the knee deep snow and
extract them again to plod on. Adding to the unpleasantness is a wind that you
are really starting to resent, blowing down from the the south. Visibility is
restricted here by the cloud cover, so it is impossible to tell how much
further the trail rises before it breaks through the worst part of mountains.
You can go up to the south, or down to the north.

    The trail drops into a small crevice here, as it makes it's way up the
side of yet another immense peak. You can't tell how far up you are for sure,
but given the practically waist deep snow and the difficulty you are having
breathing, it is higher then humanoids were built to travel for very long. The
nice thing about the crevice is that it prevents the wind from doing further
damage to you, for a while at least. The snow here is on the heavy side; large
flakes now fall around you silently. The crevice turns to the east, leading
ever upward, and to the north it returns to the lands below.

be characterized as a blizzard. You have to bend over to present as little
surface as possible to the constant force of the wind. The mountain trail is
now covered in hip deep snow and distinguishable only because the mountains to
the north and east and southwest prevent passage in those directions. You can
barely breath, and the instant crystalization of what little air you expel
tells you that continued travel here may be a fatal mistake. To the extent the
trail is visible, it leads to down the mountain to the west and up further
still to the south.

Mountain Trail~
    You are in a full force blizzard, travelling along a narrow pass near the
top of the peaks in a vast mountain range. You can just see the outlines of
the pinnacles of the mountains to your east and west, and the ground seems to
have entirely flattened out, though it is hard to be sure with the gale force
wind buffeting you about and blowing snow in your eyes. It is nearly
impossible to breathe here, the air is so thin. You are now practically
swimming in snow, and the exertion is exhausting you. The mountain path leads
further south, and to the north, where the trail descends.

Snowy Pass~
    The wind screams in your ears here, as you enter a narrow mountain pass
at the very apex of the mountain range. From what little you can tell in the
driving snow, the trail drops in elevation to the south, though it flattens
out to the north. Unfortunately, the further south you go, the deeper the snow
gets. Eventually, it reaches eye level, and you realize that further passage
in this direction is impossible. The prospects of making your way to the north
are not particularly attractive, but further travel to the south is right out,
since wading through snow above your head would certainly result in a frozen,
self-performed burial.

Valley Trail~
    The valley here is much greener than that to the north, and looking that
way you are a bit surprised by the vast difference in temperature as well.
The gentle hills to the west become steeper to the east, which is the way the
trail continues, in addition to it's sojourn through the dryer valley to the
north. You can see the great eastern desert stretching off to the northwest
from here, as you look in that direction a pyramidical shape is evident. To
the west you can just make out the outlines of rectangular object of impressive
size. Probably a city or something.

Valley Trail~
    A narrow valley extends to the south here, and to the west you can see it
ending in a riverbed, as there is a cliff apparently blocking further passage
in that direction. The landscape here is dotted with brown brush and other dry
weather foliage, though as you look to the south things get a bit greener,
probably the result of runoff from an extensive mountain range that has become
visible to the southeast. From here, you can see the whitecaps standing starkly
against the clear sky. The trail to the south looks like it's headed that way,
as the trail has a pronounced rise in that direction. You can also go west to
the dry river bed.

The Dry Ford~
    The river bed rises here slightly, and you can see that once upon a time
someone forded the river here, as the cliff that normally runs parralel to you
on the east is abated. In that direction, through a split in the cliff walls,
you can see a path winding its way through a dry hilly valley. To the west,
the trail rises up a series of switchbacks up the face of the cliff, probably
emerging somewhere in the great eastern desert above. The river bed also
continues to the north. It is very hot here.

Rest Stop Entryway~
    This area is little more than a wide tunnel bridging the rest stop commons
and the road. Once upon a time this passage and the rest stop were well-
traveled, but given the amount of the dust on the floor, it is clear that like
the road itself, it has been unused for ages. There are sconces in the walls
for torches, but none are there now - your light source provides the only
illumination. You can exit east to the ancient road, or west, where the tunnel
enters a larger area that once served as a common area.

Rest Stop Commons~
    This is a sizeable room, approximately square in shape, and almost two
hundred feet on a side. From the shape and texture of the walls you surmise
that a natural cave was enlarged to create the space you currently occupy.
The ground is flat, and unadorned. Once upon a time, weary travelers pitched
their tents here to rest before continuing on to their destination. There are
no signs of recent use, however. There are openings in the walls of this room
in all four compass directions, though your light source isn't powerful enough
to reveal where they lead.

Rest Stop Stables~
    Apparently not only could travellers rest here at the waystation, but
their steeds could as well. This medium sized room was clearly cut from the
rock, as the sharpness of the corners and smoothness of the rock rules out the
possibility of any natural cause for its formation. Little remains of the
stables themselves, as the wood that was used to separate the animals has
mostly rotted to dust. What remains is broken and useless for its original
purpose. There is only one exit from this room, which is through a passage to
the west.

Supply Center~
    This area looks to have been a supply station for weary travelers. There
is a small crack in the south wall through which water must have flowed at one
time, given the elaborate apparatus of metal gutters that lead to a small hole
in the southwestern corner of the room. No water flows there now. There are
also stone biers jutting out of the floor in four rows, upon which foodstuffs,
mount feed, and other supplies could have rested. Nothing remains of whatever
supplies were once kept here. There are two exits; back to the commons to the
north, and also through a small passage to the east.

Storage Room~
    This is a very small room, less than ten feet on a side. The roof, which
in other places in the rest stop has been a comfortable twelve feet, here drops
to seven feet, further reinforcing the sense claustrophobia one gets upon
entering. Once upon a time this place was probably used to store reserve goods
for the supply area it is adjacent to. Like the supply center itself, however,
it is now completely devoid of anything of value. In fact, it is bare of junk
as well - this place is empty. There is an exit to the west.

approximately four feet in diameter. Looking down it reveals that it drops away
out of sight. The stains along the walls tell you it was once used for waste
disposal, though the lack of any running water makes you breath a sigh of
relief that it has not been used recently. This place must have *stunk*! You
can exit to the south, back to the rest stop commons.

Ancient Road~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still in very good shape here, as the
elements have not been able to abuse it here as they have where it is exposed
to the open sky. The tunnel has collapsed to the north, and the tons of stones
and rocks that have fallen have completely blocked further passage in that
direction. It is very dark here - your light seems feeble against the pressing
darkness on all sides. You can exit south.

feet across. The stones that form it are still visible through the grass that
seems to have grown up through the cracks here and there, nourished by the
light that comes through the tunnel entrance to the south. The mouth where the
road enters the mountain here is blocked by a series of crosshatched bars of
a strange black metal. Each bar is a little less than two inches in width, and
they are spaced two feet apart, creating a square grid through which you can
see the countryside beyond. In the center of this is a gate, easily twenty feet
across and high, of the same crosshatched material, set into a rectangular
metal frame. There is no apparent lock on the gate.

You see a serene valley, with a clear blue sky and large green fields. Far
to the south you see a town, and further south you think you see the outlines
of a large castle. Apparently the mountain range you have just come through
completely surrounds this valley, because you can make out mountains forty
miles to the south, and more mountains on the east and west. They seem to
form a complete circle about the unspoilt valley you see before you.

never needed to fulfill that purpose. It has a large, complicated  locking
mechanism, which even the most competent thief would turn green trying to pick.

Stables~
    This is the north wing of the outpost's stable area. The ceiling in this
area is quite high, as in the other parts of the stables, stretching away
almost out of the range of your light source to detect. There is a pile of
dry brown dust on the ground in the southeast corner of the area. The stalls
the horses were kept in here are made of wood, but they seem to have survived
the trial of time, and are still in reasonably good shape. Fifty or so horses
could probably be stored here at maximum capacity. The only way out is to the
central stable area to the south.

    You have entered an area that at one time was used to house the mounts of
the cavalry of this outpost. Apparently, whoever they were, they rode horses
or beasts of comperable size, because the stalls here would fit animals only
that size or smaller. The ceiling in this area is considerably higher than in
the rest of the outpost, so high in fact that you can barely see the roof given
the light emitted from your source. The stables continue to the north and
south.

Barracks~
    This room once clearly served as a military barracks, where men (certainly
some kind of humanoid, from the shape of the bunks) would sleep and spend some
of their free time. There are several rows of bunks here, stacked two high for
efficiency. At the foot of each is a locker, most of which hang open, some of
which are twisted and battered - apparently from attempts of would-be looters
many years ago. There are two exits; to the east the barracks continue, and
there is also to a corridor to the north.

    This room is filled with bunks, like the barracks, but there are no double
bunks here, only singles. You also notice they are further spread apart than
in the regular barracks, thus fueling your conclusion that it is officers who
slept here. For each bunk there is a desk and mirror, though the mirrors are
detectable only by the frames they were once housed in and the fragments still
on the floor - they have all been broken. The desks hang open, some with their
drawers extracted, which explains the wood splinters all over the floor. The

    This room served as the training grounds the troops used to fine tune
their skills in battle. All of the usual equipment is here, including the
wooden counterswinger, complete with a worthless battered-looking metal
shield in one hand and a wooden club in the other. There are also several
pieces of cloth that were probably practice dummies before the hay they
contained rotten away. Plus an indented pit in the center of the room where
trainees could improve their skill at fighting on uneven ground. The yard
continues to the west, to the north there is an exit to the hallway.

Bath~
    This room served as a bath house for the soldiers of this outpost.  There
are six open pits in the stone floor, each around four feet deep and six or so
feet diameter, that served as tubs for those trying to rid themselves of dirt.
There are small channels cut into the floor, an offshoot from the main
channel, which extends from a small hole in the south wall, leads up each of
the six pits. Because all the tubs are currently dry, and look to have been so
for some time, you can see that at the bottom of each pit there is a small
opening as well. Ostensibly, water flowed through the channels, into the tubs,
and drained out through the holes. The engineering of this room impresses you
immensely. There is only one exit, to the east.

Recreation Room~
    The troops of this place apparently knew how to have a good time, as well
as to drill and fight. This rec room has a pool table, two dartboards, and a
couple of chess and checker boards sitting on the tables. Unfortunately, there
aren't any queues, darts, or complete sets to actually play the games anymore.
Best of all, there is a bar in the back, which looks like it still has some

Stairs~
    The stairs lead both up and down from here - this place is bigger than you
thought! Given what you have seen so far, you have come to the conclusion that
at one time it served as some kind of military post. From the cut of the stone
and the size of the place, you'd guess whoever made it was humanoid. And from
the musty smell in the air and the dust on the ground, it seems likely this
place is at least a couple centuries old. Who made it, and who they were
defending themselves against, remains a mystery. You can go up or down the
stairs, or exit on this level to the east.

large, and the roof is higher than most of the other parts of the outpost. It's
hard to say for sure, but it looks like the cafeteria continues on to the west.
There is also an opening in the south wall, and one in the east wall that looks

several shelves and drawers in the cabinets along the walls that have other
kitchen utensils. The ovens are what draw your attention, though. They are
both along the south wall, but are so large as to stick out several feet into
the kitchen's center. They are about ten feet tall, and tower above you
impressively. They look like they would be capable of feeding an army, which
is good, because apparently that's what they did. There are two exits; east
through a small door to a hallway, and north to the mess hall.

Practice Yard~
    This half of the practice yard must have been used for more advanced
training than in the yard to the east.  That would be your guess, anyway,
because you can't really tell how the stuff in here operates well enough to
assess what it was used for. There is one contraption with several pieces of
wire tied at varying heights between two tall, flexible wooden poles. There is
also an area where the floor is covered by a strange flexible material, which
deforms and sinks when you put weight on it. Plus, there's a large, flat piece
of wood with several holes drilled in various places all over it. Other, even
stranger devices make you scratch your head in wonder. The practice yard
continues to the east, which is the only exit.

    This room was evidently used for the storage of foodstuffs, travelling
equipment, clothing, boots, soap, and other necessities of military life. It
looks as if the room has been ransacked thoroughly by someone or something, as
all of the crates, once stacked in rows for easy access, are now scattered
about the room, ripped open and revealing what little contents that still
remain. Of the food, only a couple empty tins indicate that iron rations were
once stored here - there are none here now. All the crates have been opened,
but apparently not everything the looters discovered was of value to them. You

natural passage but the work of some intellegent species. Given the size and
orthagonality of the doorways and dimensions of the passages, you estimate
that they were probably humanoid. There are openings a little wider than that
of a door in the east and west walls, in addition to the route south along the
hallway. Peeking through the openings reveals both rooms to be storage areas,
though from here in the hall it is hard to tell what they hold. You think you
see crates. There are sconces on the walls for torches, but there are none in

looks like whatever they once held was perishable, because all that is left
now is shards of broken glass and stains on the stone floor. There are also
some wooden planks from broken barrels, along with a couple of barrels that
are still intact, lined up against the south wall. There is a square opening

skeleton still loosely attached to one of the dry webs, complete with all the
gear its owner wore ages ago. It looks like a troglodyte skeleton.  There
crates in this room are all sealed and unbroken - whoever got at the stored
goods elsewhere apparently didn't have as much luck here. From the etchings on

practically incomprehensible due to the lightness of the lines with which they

a relatively scant amount of space between the table and the walls in which to
move about the room. The table is made of a wood-like substance, but unlike the
wall maps it shows no signs of the passage of time. There are fifteen or so
large chairs set around the table, at which the commanders at one time perched
to mull over their battle plans. The only exit is to the west.

Guest's Quarters~
    This room was probably pretty nice at one time, though it looks like it
has been looted several times since the original residents left. At one time
it had a door, but it has since been wrenched off it's hinges and now lies on
the ground. There is a bed, with the stuffing ripped out and spread all over
the room, then covered with a fine layer of dust, like everything else in
here. There is also a desk, tipped over on one side with one of the legs torn
off completely. There's no sign of it now. Whatever other furtinure was here
at one time has either been stolen or smashed to bits. The only way out is
through the doorframe to the west.

Extravagant Chambers~
    Wow! This room is a stark contrast to everything else you've seen in this
place. There are unmarred furnishings here, complete with expensive tapestries
on the walls, a large, comfortable-looking bed, a desk, and a cabinet filled
with all kinds of interesting stuff. There is a pentagram pattern in the
middle of the incredibly beautiful rug that covers the floor, upon which there
is a small pedestal, which is sometimes occupied. The place shows signs of
recent use. The mahogany door to the west is the sole exit.

bed~
The bed is a heavy wooden frame upon which rests an unnaturally comfortable
mattress. The comforter seems to be made of some kind of funny material which
is both soft and yet durable. The sheets are  done in a tasteful off-white
color.
~
E
rug~
It is an expensive piece of work. The material is smooth to the touch, yet
very strong. The weave is intricate, almost hypnotizing. It is done
predominantly in black and gold, though the pentagram in the center, upon
which the pedestal rests, is done in a silvery-red.
~
E
pedestal~
A small piece of furniture constructed of a strange organic material you do
not recognize. It is rigid, yet flexible when force is exerted on it. Upon
closer examination you realize it isn't resting on the rug, but hovers a half-
inch above it. Even so, it resists all efforts to budge it. Quite unsettling.
~
E
tapestries~
Very tastefully done motifs showing the rise and fall of various civilizations.
You think at least one of them may be depicting future events, as you can see
a scene in which a town that has an uncanny resemblance to Midgaard is being
assaulted by a force of undead. It is quite disconcerting, but the living seem
to at least be holding their own in the scenes revealed there.
~
E
pentagram~
You know, the kind used for summoning and controlling demons. It's impossible
to tell if it's actually been used for that purpose, but the neatness of the
room ensures whatever demons might have been summoned certainly must have been
well behaved (and thus doubtless controlled).

    This room appears to be where all the records and books of this place were

Hallway~
    This is the northern end of a short hallway. There are sconces on the wall
for torches, but evidently no torches have blazed here for a long time. There
are openings in the walls to the north, east, and west, and the corridor
continues to the south. The bare stone of the walls is here covered up with a
thin layer of some kind of wood, which has the effect of making the place look
less austere than elsewhere. It's too dark to tell what's north or east, but
you think the room to the west is a dining hall of some sort.

Central Hallway~
    There is a set of stairs emerging from the center of the hallway here, and
the hall itself forms a square around this stair exit, thus making the corridor
here resemble a room more than a simple hall. As elsewhere, there are empty
sconces in the walls for torches. There are doors to the east and west here,
though it looks like the doorframe to the east no longer has a door on it, and
the western door is ajar. The hallway continues to the north and south, though
it looks like it terminates shortly on both ends. The stairway leads down into
darkness.

Hallway~
    This end of the hallway seems particularly dark. There are doors to the
east and south, and both look like they have resisted several attempts to
break into them. The mahogany door to the east shows far less damage than the
door to the south, however. To the west, there is a room that looks like it
was once a bath, though you can't make out the room's details from here in the
hall outside. The hallway also continues to the north.

Captain's Quarters~
    This room has a rank smell, like something died in here. This in itself
would not be so amazing if it weren't true that whatever did die in here did
it a very long time ago. Despite the passage of time, there are still very
visible bloodstains on the walls, floor, and furniture here. The rusty red
color goes quite nicely with the black color of everything else in the room,
including the walls and all the furniture. This place really gives you the
creeps for some reason. The black bed and dresser seem to have been untouched
by the passage of time, and there is a mirror atop the dresser that is, quite
amazingly, unbroken. Doubtless an artifact of this room's having been sealed.
There is an exit through the door to the north.

There is a stove, and what looks like a pantry, with an old, rusted-looking
lock that is still, curiously enough, intact. You can exit to the mess hall
southwards.

Officer's Mess~
    This room served as the dining chamber of the commanders of this place,
and whatever guests they happened to be entertaining. There are four tables
in this mid-sized room, each successively a bit nicer than the one before,
going clockwise from the northeastern most table. There are no settings on
any of them now. There is a doorway to the north, with only swinging doors
separating this room from the kitchen that you can just make out in that
direction. You can also exit to the hallway eastwards.

    The door to this room looks a bit battered, but at least it's still on its
hinges and capable of closing. The room is sparsely furnished, though it looks
like at one time it might have been rather nicely decorated. What is left of
the furniture in here is pretty much destroyed. What once might have been a
bed is now just a lot of broken wood and torn cloth scattered around the floor.
The dresser is in slightly better shape, at least you can still recognize how
the pieces once fit together. Everything is here is looking pretty broken. The
exit is east.

Bath~
    There are two pits in this room that once served as tubs for the officers
to bathe in. They are both dryed out now, though the channels in the floor
through which the water used to run are still intact. A small hole in the
north wall is the source of the channels in the floor that lead to the two
now-empty pits. A small hole at the bottom of each provides drainage. There
is a single exit, it is to the east.

It's pretty small, but by shining your light down it you can tell that it
curves after dropping a foot or so. It was made, it is not natural, just

They are narrow gutters in the floor of the room through which water flowed

It's right where the floor meets the south wall, near the center. It's only

    This room is entirely unlike the rough, natural stone of the passages to
the north. It is apparently a storeroom, though it looks as if it has been
unused for some time. There are crates lining the walls, some of which are
broken and have spilled their contents onto the floor. Unfortunately, it
looks like whatever they once held was perishable, because all that is left
now is shards of broken glass and stains on the stone floor. There are also
some wooden planks from broken barrels, along with a couple of barrels that
are still intact, lined up against the south wall. There is a square opening
in the east wall, unlike the small jagged hole in the south that leads back to
the tunnels.

the lab is a small altar to the gods. There is a single bed, a big wooden desk
with chair on rollers behind it, and also a big warchest, now open, in which
you can see an impressive array of hard won treasures. Clearly the resident of

The Master Alien's Lair~
You stand in awe of the statue of a powerful Alien.  The statue is
carved out of unflawed, pure-black obsidian and it shines with an erie
read aura.  The signs of a great battle mark the room, however, the
statue is untouched.  Heaps of bone lie against the walls, coagulated
blood stains the ground and acid burns mark the entire room. You feel
very uncomfortable standing in this rom.

Looking through the CageDoor you see a dank, dark place. It is rather large
and has rusting metal walls. On the ground is a two foot layer of water.
You hear something sloshing around in there but you don't see anything. However,
being overcome with fear, you know something very horrible is in there.

statue alien~
The Alien Statue is powerful and evil looking, something tells you that the
mayhem of this room was done by something like this. You wouldnt want
to piss off anything that resembles this statue. It has a mouth within a mouth,
a long slashing tail, and a set of huge claws, all of withc look very
damaging.

bone heap heaps~
Bones from anything and everything you can think of lie here, even 
some things that you cant think of (ain't that a pisser). You might be
able to find a few gold fillings or some ruined jewelery in there if you

You stand before a massive mast which holds the mainsail of the S.S.Minnow.
Looking around you see the main deck of the ship cluttered with all sorts

Underneath the S.S.Minnow~
You are under the S.S.Minnow, what more can you want?  Actually, you
are getting tired of swimming along with the ship.  Either swim a little
faster to emerge in front of the ship or swim west to where the ladder
to the ship is. Or, try your luck and found out what is deep under the ocean.

The Grubby Cellar~
  You have found your way into a nasty, dirty room with lots of horrid 
smelling debris.  The first thing you notice is that the walls look strangely
fake, like they are made of some kind of plastic.  As you move to closer 
inspection you see that they have small bits of writing declaring them as
building materials stolen from a construction site.  The floor is dirt and 
rock, mostly dirt.  A few small spider webs have formed in the corners and
a hole, that looks to be the right size for a mouse, has been made in the 
north wall.  This place really smells and you wouldn't mind leaving it as
quickly as possible.

Hole in the ground~
This may be a hole in the ground to some people, but to Arioch, Homey, and
Gorby it's home.  As you walk in you notice the stench emanating from one of
the corners of the room.  As you walk in further you notice a small figure
huddled in a corner of the room.  He says "Hello, my names Rathead.  Who
are you?"  You cringe at the name of the famous thief.  He notices this 
reaction and reassures you, "I don't steal anymore," that is unless he's
bored.~

Feith's Sanctuary~
Well, actually, it's more of a den of thieves than a sanctuary....
To the north lies a dusty curtain, barely concealing the glare of uncertainty 
behind it. Don't bump into the sliding glass door to the west, through which
the voyeuristic thief can view the antics of his next-door neighbor on his
west. Meanwhile, to the east, a black circle shimmers on the wall, as if a
hole had been painted on it. AND, of course, the obligatory trap door on the 
floor concealed beautifully by ceramic tiles mosaically aligned on the floor.
up is... well...UP, ya know?

Welcome to the interior of Ivy's pet cat Slut.  You must either be a very
powerful spell-caster, or the friend of one, even to be here.  We, however,
shan't even bore you with the details of how you got to be so small, and why
neither you, nor the organism that you presently are occupying, suffer from
this situation.  Let it be observed that the hostess and owner of said
organism probably is responsible and therefore thanked.  Should you like
to stay a while and chatter, there is a stomach that you could use as a 
sofa, or lungs that you could use a cushions, and hookworms that you can
discuss politics with.  Should you feel thirsty, just lean over and drink from
the spleen.  At any rate, welcome and make yourself at home.  Should Ivy not
be at home, please leave all in order seeing as Slut might have problems
digesting and breathing otherwise, to say the least.

A dark path~
    You stand on a dark path winding it's way into the woods.  You notice
things getting darker as you move closer to the forest.  The path continues
north and south.

The tall oak~
    You stand before a giant oak tree.  It towers above you, dwarfing even
other tall trees around it.  The path forks here, branching off to either
side of the tree.  On the western path, an elf sits on a stump, carving a new
bow.  He looks up and calls out to you.

A small piece of bark justs out from the base of the great oak.  Could this
be a handle of some sort?

The leafy path~
    With Timnus's blessing and best wishes, you journey westward into the
Elven Forest.  The forest is not quite so dark now, and many small animals
can be seen near this leaf-covered path.  The path continues to the north.

Tongue on Blue Square~
    You stand in the center of a giant, swirling chaos.  However, as you
stand here, things start to become more geometric.  Now you can see exits
in all six directions leading away through a colorful mist.

Sunsor's Office~
     You are in a very luxuriously furnished room.  Against the far wall is a
giant marble desk with a very large black leather chair.  Directly opposite
the desk is an entertainment center with all the comforts of home.  Glancing
around some more, you suddenly realize that there is no floor in this room!
After some careful inspection, you realize that the entire floor is made of
glass, providing a breathtaking view of the city of Midgaard.  Around the 
room, the walls are covered with charts.  On these charts, Sunsor keeps track
of all players' deeds (good and bad).  Suddenly, a large, black leather sofa
appears for you to sit upon.

Avenger's Tower~
    This room radiates some strange form of energy.  Even though small in
size, this room holds quite a large amount of equipment.  As you glance over
some of the brightly glowing objects, you notice several black pedestals that
were not there a moment ago.  Upon them are the most prized of all trophies:
Glaive, Avenger's weapon, floats above the pedestal, humming softly.  The head
of the Giant Purple Sand Worm is immortalized in a crystal sphere resting
now so lifelessly on it's pedestal.  The skull of the Dracolich glares at you
even now, you could almost swear that the eye sockets begin to glow red!
Finally, another pedestal comes into view, however nothing lies on it...
You wonder what else could possibly add to the collection when you notice the
word 'kris' carved into the base.

up ahead.  Maybe whatever made the path lives in there?

The bear cave~
    You seem to have intruded upon the happy home of a family of grizzlys.
Mama bear sleeps soundly knowing that her cubs are safe.  It would probably
be wise to keep it that way..

Entrance to the Elven Forest~
    You have entered into the fabled Elven Forest.  Here all the animals
live together, letting Mother Nature do her bidding.  You can hear birds
chirping and squirrels playing, and off in the distance you can hear the
gentle sounds of a brook flowing by.  There a a sign posted here that says:

sign~
Welcome to the Elven Forest.  To help keep your visit a safe one, we ask
that you do not venture into parts of the forest in which you do not belong.
 
The forest is divided into three (3) segments:
 
1) The Pine Trail and The Brook.   (Intended for levels 1-3)

2) The Maple Grove and Meadow.     (Intended for levels 4-6)

3) The Orchard of the Elven King.  (Intended for levels 7-9)

Also, it would be more than wise to use the "buddy system" when fighting. 
It's saved lives in the past - it could save yours...
 
 
                                             Happy Hunting!
                                             Management

The Pine Trail~
    You are walking along what seems to be a well travelled path through a 
forest full of tall pines.  You look up in awe at these magnificent trees,
towering above everything in the forest.  The trail leads further to the 
north, and you see what appears to be a brook to the west.  You also see some
broken brances in the brush to the east.  It seems possible to pass through
the brush in several spots.

The Quiet Brook~
    You are standing in the middle of a quietly flowing brook.  The water
feels cool and relaxing as it flows over your travel-worn feet.  Some brook
trout swim by, making you feel hungry.  Actually, now would be a good time
to stop and rest - and you could drink some water and eat some fresh fish
while you're at it.

By an old tree stump~
    Here, in the middle of the forest trail, lies an old tree stump.  It looks
very sturdy and comfortable, and this seems to be a nice place to rest.  The
pine trail continues to the north and south, and there seems to be some 
source of water to the west.  You also notice some broken brances in the 
brush to the east.  It seems possible to pass through in that direction as
well.

A natural spring~
    Here in front of you is the source of the brook water.  A nice flow of
water is coming out from between two rocks, forming this gently flowing 
brook.  This looks like an excellent place to take a drink, since you have
never seen water as sparkling clear as this.  The brook continues north and
south, and you see an old tree stump on the shore to the east.

trees west of here and a row of maple trees east of here.  The brush

and warm here, you almost feel like lying down and enjoying the sunshine. 
West of here is a large grove full of maple trees.

the orchard and spotted you.  He screams for the guards, and then drops to
his knees and prays for you.  A feeling of great fear overwhelms you, as
you KNOW that you are not alone up in this tree.  You suddenly wish you'd

The Entrance to Deadhame~
     You stand at the mouth of a large, man made tunnel.  The smell
of rotting flesh is strong here.  The feeling that you are about
the only one in the area not yet dead comes over you, making chills
run down your spine.  A large sign looks like it should be examined.

sign~
     You are at the entrance to Deadhame, an area designed for low 
level characters to explore and conquer.  Most of the monsters here
are well-trained not to attack players unless provoked.  As one 
goes downstairs, he is likely to encounter greater challenges than
he would on the first level, and he might even cross paths with one
of the bad-tempered monsters.  If you are 1-3rd level, you would be
well advised to adventure here as part of a group, or you will find
yourself overwhelmed.  If you are well over 8th level, you may find
the challenges here to be fading, and it is likely time for you to
move on to bigger things.~

A hallway~
     You stand in a hallway which runs from East to West.  It is well

rocky earth about, and the ceiling is supported by sturdy wooden

Side Street~
This street is crowded with rubble and garbage.  A lot of dust has been
accumulating here and you notice that the ground seems to be rather worn
in the center of the alley.  From somewhere up ahead you hear the sounds of
fighting.  You can clearly see a white hat on a stranger and you recognize
the face from wanted posters.  Its BILLY THE KID!!

dungeon, bones lie strewn about the room. The only exit from 
this room is to the south. The wall to the west has a small 
split down the middle... it appears as if it could be opened.

entirely of silver set against the south wall. A gruesome thing
lies in the center of the room, some disgusting green liquid
oozes from many small bubbles on the creatures flesh. The sight

They are constantly at War with each other and are known to hunt each other
down and attack. It is best if you don't get in their way, but even then,
they have been known to come out of no where and attack outsiders. Watch
your step around here!!

Good Luck and Enjoy Your Visit!! (remember: you don't live here, they do)

     WELCOME!!

The Land Down Under is mainly controlled by two groups: the Aborigines and
the Roos. Some of them don't care about outsiders, others..... well they
sometimes seem to come out of nowhere and attack without warning!!
    These two groups are at war with each other and will attack each other
if they see someone of the other side. Try not to get in their way....
    There are several dangerous creatures here, but with a bit of common
sense, you should be able to avoid most of them.
Good Luck and Enjoy your visit! (remember: you don't live here, they do...)
