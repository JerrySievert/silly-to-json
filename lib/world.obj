This oddly colored book was obviously written by a druid (that probably would
explain the color) and dicusses various trees and such that live in the forest.
One thing that does catch your eye is a chapter about telling which trees are
able to cast spells. Apparently, Eucalyptus trees and the trees that "shiver"
do not cast spells, but the trees that "moan" do.

nobody knows what started the fighting (not even they remember anymore), some
historians believe it has something to do with the death of a Roo princess and
an Aborigine prince.

Chapter 2, verses 9-21
And St. Antioch raised the hand grenade up on high saying 'Oh, Lord,
bless this thy hand grenade, that with it thou may blow thy enemies to
tiny bits in thy mercy.'. And the Lord did grin, and the people did
feast upon the lambs and sloths and carps and anchovies and orangutan

and breakfast cereals and fruit bats......

And the Lord spake saying 'First thou shall take out the holy pin,
then shall thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be
the number thou shall count, and the number of the counting shall be
three. Four shall thou not count, neither shall thou count two, excepting
that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three,
being the third number, be reached, then lobbeth thou thy holy hand
grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight,
shall snuff it.'
